Vodaphone Almost Ruined My Life - Stolen Identity - 0 Security,"My email and password were part of a company database leak a few months ago and hackers managed to access my Vodaphone account without my knowledge. (Vodaphone has 0 security in place, they don't even offer 2FA (Two Factor Authentication).ber so I had no phone or any means of contacting them). 

Within 15 minutes my life was upside down. I quickly realised I was now obviously not able to contact anyone or do anything with my phone as my sim had been canceled. These fraudsters had waited until the Vodaphone has shut on Friday afternoon before porting my number using vodaphone.com, knowing I could not visit a store for help. 

They then proceeded to recover my passwords for over 500 accounts as they were able to use my phone for the two-factor authentication.  They stole tens of thousands of dollars and made my life a living hell! I spent the next 3 days doing everything I could to stop them. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do as they now had my identity. 

I was locked out of every account I own and essentially had my identy stolen. They cataloged all my backup passwords, recovery keys, and much more so that in the event that I did get my account back they could instantly recover it again.

Misguided Sale,"Misguided SaleCouple of days ago, I was told that I will get $500 + Trade-in value of my old phones. When I purchase any new phone.I ordered 3 phones (2x Iphone Max and 1x Samsung Note20).When sale completed, I was told to download Trade-in App and provide trade in reference Number.Today I called to 1555 with Trade-in reference of my old phone, Vodafone sales person told me that $500 trade-in is available to only with new Samsung S21.Anyone can help me to resolve the issue or should I go to The Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO).Vodafone sales team in India (1555) are not willing to help.",1
Worst network,"Worst network for data in Australia. I used Vodafone for mobile phone but when I need data away from my home wifi, I hate Vodafone. When I am on a highway, I am sure I do not get network for calls.",1
Insurance contract with them is bulshit,"They charged me for over a year a plan with insurance, which would provide me one month free phone, now after I make a claim of a spare phone to send my one to fix they said not having it available at the moment. So why they offer a product they can not attend?Terrible service, stay away of it",1
RECORD all your phonecalls with them when you have issues!!!!,"My parents and I have been with Vodafone for about 20 years. Thats strictly due to not finding another company with decent coverage and cheap prices. However, we would leave Vodafone in a heart beat should something else come along.ones. They offered to completely wipe the bills of the previous phone and have it removed. For the past 6 months i thought i had been paying for one phone, turns out the bill was for both. There is no record in the notes on their system stating any of that was promised which means, i now have to continue owing that. 

Please get everything in writing and record phone calls! If they say something make them write it up in an email and send it to you WHILE youâ€™re on the phone. Get all names down from the call workers. Record the phone call so if needed you can write down the phone call and take things further. You can also address the fact that youre recording to then make it legal.",1
Just as bad as telstra,Don't understand why I'm getting messages 2 days late and some aren't even getting through. If this is not sorted I'll be going else where,1
They alter your call records,"Definitely 0.They issue bills with incorrect call/sms history. Keep track and see for yourself. Stay away, although the other providers probably aren't much better.",1
Don't waste your money on a piece of crap  prepaid Vodafone mobile phone.I reckon a current affair should look into this.,Crap coverage constant drop outs and there is no such thing as sufficiently fast. You are rip offs. Scum bags.,1
They don't want my money,"Tried to sign up to a new plan for their bonuses, however offered to just give me a sim and get the phone after a couple months (i.e. so no bonus preorders)",1
Mobile coverage far worse than Telstra,Planning on switching my mobile phone service back to Telstra as the mobile coverage is pretty poor. Lots of areas with no coverage. SOS only.The broadband though is very fast,2
"Patchy service at times, but good customer service makes all the difference","A telco with good customer service? I didn't think it was possible, but as a smartphone enthusiast and someone who (mostly) knows what they're doing, Vodafone staff have been excellent. Every person I've spoken to is really nice and knows what they're doing, and very transparent with the customer. You can even still call Vodafone instead of chat, and get through to an awesome member of staff with little wait time.lans is the same as Optus, which, for the most part, has better reception in more places and a larger 5G network.

I haven't had any billing issues yet unlike Telstra, and unlike both Optus and Telstra you'll get the same (usually correct!) answer from any staff member.

I really hope the merger with TPG doesn't erode all the good things Vodafone has worked on up to this point.",4
Absolutely useless call centre. Can't actually make any changes to account without going into the building,"I called up today (on my registered Vodafone number) to enquire about upgrading my phone plan. I don't know my personal pin that was set more than 2 years ago. So, I had to verify my identity, I then proceeded to verify it but it was declined as they have my old address on file. I explained this then they wouldn't let me try and verify again.I had two options use there online verification tool that takes two days or head into a busy supermarket to risk COVID.I then tried the online verification tool only to have a text back saying my verification wasn't verified. Not impressed at all. I am paying for a service and can't even access my account to make changes. Everyday this goes on I'm paying more than I should be and can't cancel my account.",1
0 stars if I could,"Vodafone has been by far the absolute worst NBN provider out of the lot. Their service is complete and utter RUBBISH! Speeds are no where near quoted, even in non peak times with continual drop outs. As we speak I'm on my second day of complete no service. The 4G modem is also the biggest POS, it self resets every 15 minutes when it's on 4G (by design according to Vodafone tech support) that's if you can even get it to work in the 4G backup mode in the first place. Please your own sanity AVOID LIKE THE CORONAVIRUS!",1
Vodafone Sales team divulge our confidential information to third party for fraudulently purchase phone under our name.,"On 20th January 2021 I called Vodafone sales team to upgrade my phone in to new iPhone Max 256 GB phone and I havenâ€™t not processed because I havenâ€™t got better deal.On the same day at 6.08 pm I got a phone call from 02 9052 4954 saying with regards to the phone inquiry I had with Vodafone they wish to better deal that with new phone I need to pay only A$91.08 and without any payment for my existing handset.set and they said yes, they can see the order in the system. Then I asked the monthly payments and the existing handset payments waive off. They too confirm thatâ€™s was right. Then I said them I didnâ€™t Proceed the order and asked them to check the delivery address. Ten they inform incorrect address. Then I asked them whether they can cancel the order and the guy who originally called me informed me he would call me back to proceed with the order. So I said I would take this with the person who originally called me.So he called me back again and told me the address corrected and sent me the confirmation saying exiting phone payment waived and only pay for new phone set  and the phone bil.
As I had so many problem during last 8 year with Vodafone when buying new phone as they never give the discount what they agreed when buying phone,I called them in the morning. Again they said what in the order correct but delivery address was wrong.then I said to correct and a lady who call not to worry and the delivery address would correct and gave me a reference no.But I was still not sure and then I called Vodafone accounts and checked.then thre were the one informed me that I need to pay my old phone balance and some one has fraudulently put the order by online by accessing my detail and as the phone already ordered although the phone was still not dispatched they need Police report to investigate.
Actually Vodafone sales team divulge our confidential information for the fraudulent activities for the others.",1
Excellent customer service,I was having problems with another service provide and went to a Vodafone store to see what they offer.  The customer supervise was excellent and the solutions they provided are exactly what I needed.  You actually speak to real people unlike another service provider that keeps getting me diverted to automated systems that donâ€™t work.,5
Renegged on their contract,"I took out a post paid plan with vodafone called sim only plan which gave you $7 discount each month. To be eligible for this, you had to lock in 24 month. This plan worked well for me though coverage not so great all the time. Now vodafone has renegged on their conditions saying I have lost $5 of the origin credit as I have changed plans. I cannot change my plan as I agreed to the lock in of 24 months to get it but I am now expected to pay $28 for the remaining 8 months of the agreed 24 months. Can they legally brake their side of a contract. This is disgusting behaviour and I will be visiting their stores as one cannot communicate their dispair and frustration by talking to customer service when they don't speak clear English. DO NOT GO WITH VODAFONE.",1
The never ending story,"An excerpt from my email to the wonderfully excessively unhelpful Vodafone. Please note that I managed to write all of that without the use of one swear word.go to my local store and get one. 

I made my way to the Ocean Keys shopping Centre in Clarkson where they told me I was silly for ordering on line, that nothing done online ever works properly and I should always come in store if I need anything. They provided me with a SIM but could not get it to activate and after several calls to Vodafone they said it should be on in about half an hour. The following day I returned to the store as it wasn't working and was told they couldn't help me I would need to call Vodafone myself (so much for always going to them).  A week later and numerous calls and messages and finally I got my phone connected. We're off to a bumpy start. 

Then horror of horrors - there's a recall.  As directed I went to my local store  (the same incompetent people listed above). Was told that wasn't a problem and to perform a factory reset as I had already backed up my data. When the reset was complete I was then informed that because it was purchased online they couldn't help me as they couldn't access proof of purchase and that now that I don't have a phone I need to drive for 20mins to the nearest major shopping centre to go to the Samsung store there as they would have records and could do the swap. 

I did as instructed.  Was told by the lovely people at Samsung that that wouldn't be a problem and to take a seat and someone could arrange that for me in about 10mins. 30mins later a gentleman tells me that they can't do that there and that he would walk me to the Joondalup Vodafone Store where it wouldn't be a problem as they would be able to sort it out. Steam is starting to come from my ears at this point.

Treat like a stupid...,"I got my plan updated last month and they ask me to update my phone as well and I ask. For iPhone 7 . They just said yeah yeah , u will really enjoy this plan . Nothing comes out , didn't give me any tracking I'd for my iPhone 7 that I had ordered , just making me fool that they just want to add up in Their bills,  raised that one to $176.00.  I called 9 times to customer care and they all ignore me, careless staff , no importance of customers . It's better to get Telestra or Optus as they have good staff response and value then these frauds.Going to cancel all plans .",1
STAY AWAY - choose another provider,"Dreadful customer service.  Appalling.  Have been a Vodafone customer since 1998 - 18 years.  Have my whole family on their network with a range of products, stuck with them even during their dodgy network coverage, and this year have experienced the WORST customer service and product downgrades.  Having just returned a dodgie iPhone for the second time in a month (1st time touch screen not working took four weeks to get new handset, 2nd time internal battery gone on replacement iPhone only two weeks old) - with no loan phone available.  It was killing us then the store person today basically accused us of mistreating the phones. There isn't a scratch on them.  STAY AWAY.  CHOOSE ANOTHER PHONE PROVIDER.  We have tried everything for them to be reasonable - even if they provided us a cheap (working) loan phone we'd be happy - but no.  The only thing we can do is vote with our feet and take our $4000 a year of business elsewhere.",1
"Horrific reception, and customer service","If I could go lower than one star I would. Avoid Vodafone at all costs, they are 100 percent a scam company. I called to cancel my service due to poor reception. I mean my friend was getting 3 bars at my house while I was getting sos only and this was in a fair sized town near Brisbane! The Vodafone rep begged and pleaded with me to stay, saying they had scheduled work in the area just that night. This work was apparently ""guaranteed to fix my reception issue"". Bull! They wanted another month of billing because it was supposed to reset tomorrow. So I canceled everything and I repeated to them that I didn't want the number and I didn't want to have Vodafone service any more. I finished the call thinking the cancellation was complete and done with. Like many other people sometimes I don't check my bills online, 3 months down the line I notice i am still getting charged by Vodafone 52 dollars each month! I called them and demanded my money back, but denied it completely! They said that I was supposed to call back and have the number changed over to the other provider but I had specifically stated I didn't want the number any more. They made up lies and said that I had been using data on my Vodafone account each month, which is a load of rubbish. AVOID THIS COMPANY AT ALL COSTS! You have been warned!",1
Dreadful Service,"I have a story that begins with such a little problem but ended up with such frustration that I will not be coming back to Vodafone despite being a loyal customer for more than a decade.Let's start with the little problem. I was trying to send a text to a competition 19 number. I'd done it plenty of times in the past but all of a sudden it wouldn't go through and after repeat tries...no luck.I reported it to Vodafone's customer service. To cut a long long story short. After a number of calls they said I needed to go to a Vodafone shop. They also said if there was a problem with the phone I would need to pay a $200 deposit to get a loan phone.
My complaint: The customer service line seems to be an internet line and the quality was poor (good for a Telco haha). Couple this with people that don't speak clear English and frustrations rise. The hide of these people to fob me off to a store AND probably pay a deposit for something that is totally not my fault. Can't wait till my contract is over!!! Crazy how a little thing that could have been so easily solved has lost them a customer. Join me, let's get rid of Vodafone.",1
Afrian call coverage,Thanks vodafone for painting Africa Grey in your International calls coverage. The millions of African people love it in Grey. It looks pretty,1
Overbilling,"Have signed a contract with Vodafone for almost 2 years now and they provide the decent data reception. Although, I have been charged $10 additional to my usual bill of $87 every month which is ridiculous considering I check everyday for my remaining data, turning it off whenever it reaches 200mb or less. The remaining data level in the Vodafone app is completely unreliable, updating itself every 24 hours and the alternative method of checking through texting 1315 always states a false number causing you to go over your real limit. I will never a contract with them again and would rather go with virgin mobile.",2
Unlimited calls India,I am not happy from Vodafone because they are not giving unlimited international calls that's why I m going for boost because they are giving unlimited international calls with 40$If Vodafone can give me unlimited calls to international I can keep Vodafone,2
The worst customer service and team!!!,"Finished my contract with them 2012, and spoked with the customer care, and explained to them we moving the house that Vodafone can't reach the signal. I closed contract just in time finished my contract with Vodafone as well like 24 months contract. Anyway they keep trying me stay with them, and tried gives me an offer best price, got transfer to they manager in charge on that time. And I explained it to manager why I'm not going to continue with them and suddenly I heard he (manager) was  yawning while I Still talking to him. and he keep talking bla bla I don't understand what he saying and he said thank you already had experienced with Vodafone and he hung up the phone.

And now 2016 bad faults credit history and I checked it was from Vodafone. So I rang the customer service again today Wednesday 2 November at 5:26 pm. Try look my history number with them it's said I still have balance with them over $1000. Its sucks because you have to pay to get a rid the bad credit history report and you can do anything with it and the customer service also really bad experience, and I can hear the background laughing like all the team having picnic at work with foreign language (Indian) I don't meant racist but it's sounds like Vodafone never gives good training for the staff. And the one who's talking with me the tone of her like want to quickly finish the conversation sound like rushing with the accent that I can pick up barely the word by words what she saying. And i gives up had 40 minutes on the phone mostly I'm just waiting she put it on hold. It's really bad experienced for me. I think Vodafone need selective their staff. Not just looking for cheap staff or low pay rate to keep it going theirs business. So stay away from this provider",1
Poor Customer Service.,"Used to have a number of plans with this teleco. Including 2 mobiles and 1 mobile broadband wifi a/c after fullfilling 2nd 2 year contract with mobiles they failed to offer anything else which was even close to the current plans we had- so we went elsewhere, this left us with just our mobile broadband and after switching to the NBN - as vodafone doesn't offer and NBN plans, cancelled our broadband with them- so I thought but received a bill 8 weeks later!!! For the billing period after the one I had cancelled!   They simply refused to admit it was their fault and best they could do was 'reduce' the bill, needless to say that the account was inactive for 2 months! Pretty disappointed! And unprofessional for such a large company! Gee Vodafone pick up your act- plenty more telecos out there that are willing to look after their customers!",2
Treated like an idiot,"I was with Vodafone for years - since I had my first mobile, up until last year. I travelled to Melbourne and the area had poor reception 3g and 4g, which is fine not all areas can be fantastic I understood that. But then one morning my phone started going crazy at 5am with exceed data messages. You have almost hit your limit, 5 minutes later you have reached your limit. Within an hour from the first message I got the final one saying I had used over 20gb. I didn't have wifi/hot spot on and the only thing it was connected to was a charger. I rang up to ask what was going on, he decided since I was too risky he would shut down my account leaving me with no way of contacting anyone. Had to ring back on my sisters phone, was told I must have been streaming music, 20gb is ALOT of music, I said that was a joke, reception is bad in the area, if its hard enough to make a phone call how could I possible stream 20gb of music. My phone was turned back on for calls only. I rang again and said they didn't turn my data on I was told there was work happening in the area no one had data. Was trying to use my phone for a gps the next day and it still didn't work, rang back up and was told my data was deactivated because I was refusing to pay. Finally got a hold of a decent customer service officer who looked at my previous history of 2gb a month barely, said it was strange gave me a case number and told me to head into a shop who checked the data history on my phone and found nothing. Finally had data restored but then got the bill for the month and it hadn't been fixed up on there. Rang back, was treated like an idiot by customer service who just kept telling me to learn how computers and data works so I can avoid this issue in the future. Only way I got them to fix it was by threatening to go to the ombudsman.

I now use Optus. 8gb and unlimited calls for half the price of Vodafone.

I still think they way they calculate data is completely wrong and people should be wary of additional data charges because I doubt Im the only one",1
Iphone 7 plus,"The worst service provider in terms of rewarding you with the loyalty. The customer service specially one those offer phone on plans, they took the whole day to give me best deal but at the end of day after 8 hours of hassle came with the plan that sounded liked wow....but in real fact I was paying more than the initial deal. Very unethical and unprofessional customer service provider just thinking of their sales, don't care about customer and their line managers are more ridiculous in terms of the way they deal.",1
Southland Shopping Centre Pityful,"Never buy a phone from this store. Rude, Ignorant, could not care less. Happy to take your money but totally disgusted with there after sale service.",1
Bad signal,"Very bad signal.from my train station(Carlton) up to (Bondi) i can get more then one bar, five years now. I think it's  time to update there network.",3
I can't recommend my friend and whoever to take Vodafone service which is not good quality service,"Now i have Vodafone postpaid plan and i am going to cancel my plan soon. If i need to data, it will not work.",1
don't join with vodafone!!!!,"Overcharged $1900 for their mistake. Asked to cancel the data for my iPad over a year ago since I was not using it, however they havent canceled it and i was continued to be charged. It has now accumulated to over $1900 and without warning, no letters or emails. I just receieved a call from debt collecters explaining to me that i have an unpaid bill from vodafone. Now me, my partner, and both our families are canceling out memberships with vodafone, or not renewing our contrats with them when theyve ended. Youve lost 20 members for life for unethical business. I shouldnt have to pay for your mistake.",1
Monthly SIM only plan for International calls,"I couldn't be happier with what Vodafone has offered me in last 1 year. A few good things:
I am in no way affiliated with Vodafone and am not getting any kind of reward for writing this review. I am just too satisfied a customer to not highlight what they are doing good. May they continue adopting better practices.",5
Galaxy s7 edge fire risk,Vodafone won't guarantee reliability of phone and ignore the fact that these phone's worldwide are exploding!! I have lost faith totally in product and service.,1
iPhone 7 Plus,"I previously finished by contract with Vodafone so I decided to upgrade to the new iPhone 7 plus. I was told that there would be a 4-6 week wait for the phone which I was happy to wait for. Then I get an email a week after I placed my order from Vodafone and they say the estimated delivery date is 'December 7th'. This is actually 9-10 weeks after I placed by order and is no where near the estimated 4-6 weeks like I was promised. The whole reason I decided to take the plan was because I was promised by the Vodafone employee 4-6 weeks as I am going on holiday on the 1st of December for 6 weeks! And needed the phone for obvious reasons. So I decided to go back to Vodafone to ask why my phone was going to take so long to be delivered. They told me that their employee had read the wrong shipping date for my phone and they cannot do anything about the date. Absolutely ridiculous, I don't see how they employee could of read the wrong shipping date after I specifically asked him how long the phone was going to take; was he only saying this to try and get more sales? For his benefits? Cannot believe this appalling service and I will not be a returning customer after my plan has expired!",1
Disgusting Vodafone,Vodafone is Terrible as I am a 6 years customer and want to change provider and they are charging me $100 for 2 days. Disgusting service after 6 years with Vodafone.,1
"Terrible, scum, company","I applied for a service with vodafone and was declined!This company apparently declined me, not due to my credit rating but due to my credit score!They said even though I was approved of a car loan, i was overlooked for a mobile phone, due to the fact I had a low credit score.Also I declined other mobile services due to being too expensive and vodafone was cheaper for the same thing!No apologies made by them!If someine gets approved for a min $5000 car loan, surely a mobile phone is secondary!?Also this appeared on my credit score!!!Vodafone NO WAY!!",1
Rude and patronizing - Voda staffs.,"Rude and patronizing behaviour by a call centre staff in India, and a customer service staffin Hurstville NSW (before the downfall). Safe yourself time and energy. Go Optus.",1
The best,"I walk into Optus and there customer service was horrible, so horrible in fact I just walked out.  When I went to Vodafone I was approached with a very nice man who took me through my plan.  Go Vodafone",5
Vodafone customer care.,"Visited Vodafone Mawson lakes few days ago, Michelle was very supportive and caring. Provided details of every possible plan to choose from. great experience.",5
Cheap Plan. Bad Coverage.,"The coverage is good in urban areas. It does not cover mountain or rural areas as I went on a road trip with my friend. We received no reception at all, which did cause some trouble for us to find our way to the destination.I will recommend vodafone service to those who need a cheap plan, make international calls and rarely travel.",3
Worst customer service,I ordered a new phone but so called customer service people didn't know the colour of the phone putting order wrong at least 3 times and then on that adding 2000$ on my account so i ended up cancelling my order. Have to call them again and again to fix things and still waiting the bills after 6 weeks. Dishonest and worthless service i ever received.,1
Vodafone are crap,Vodafone take your money and supply you with dodgy service. I was on a $100 a month plan with 12 gig of data i went ovet every month (according to vodafone) and was chaged around $30 to $70 on top of my $100 a month plan. I switched to optus and only have 3 gig a month i use my phone exactly how i did when i was with vodafone and strangely enough i have never used more tha 3 gig. The customer service people are rude and incompatent on 3 occassions i called to cancel my plan and i was told it had been canceled but i would still recieve bills when i rang to ask them why i was still being billed they said i was using their service after i was told it had been cancelled. When itold them i rang up to cancel they said there were no notes in the system and they could not help me and i would have to pay the bill. If you want to get ripped off use vodafone.,1
Perfect Plan For Me,"I have been with Vofafone for many years and they have supplied me with the perfect plan for me, I don't use my phone much ( Nokia 6300 ) so the plan that I have been on is where I have to spend $5 per year to keep it active, and yes their coverage isn't quite the best, but that seems to be improving with time... as a customer of Vodafone I am and have been very satisfied!!! Great value for money in my oppinion!",5
Perfect Plan For Me,"Hey again, getting close to the end of 2018 and I am still on the same plan, I have a slightly better mobile phone now iPhone S4, as the 2G network has ended, still very happy, and have no thoughts of changing or upgrading to another plan, my last bill was under $5 over two months, I have better make some calls to get over the $5 to keep my plan active... Thanks Vodafone...!",5
Bad signal still expesnsive,I got samsung 6 edge foe $96 plan. I have poor signal at home ashfield. Customer service would say its a technical issue its getting repaired. After 2-3 months when i called again with same problem. They would say we cant see any issues. They dont listen to customers they think they are right. After six months now i moved to pottspoint in sidney city. Terrible network in the apartment. Sick of calling vodafone. Worst network. I would have surely changed my network if was not in the plan.Please do not take Vodafone even if you are in the cities of Australia,1
"Liar and Dishonest company, says something and do another...","Network is average drops sometimes, company always misleads customers on their quota and credits you will be surprised if you see their promise and actual credit you getting.",1
Pathetic,"Worst customer service, i got a phone with my contract that didnt work properly and took it back within 28 days, they said they fixed it and it should be fine. I then returned a week later with the same issue and they said sorry its been longer than 28 days of purchase and theres nothing we can do. I told them i came within 28 days with the same issue and they said sorry if it was an issue it should of been rectified then and there. so now im stuck with a phone that doesnt work",1
"Worst customer service, biggest liar","I upgraded my old plane to the new IPhone 7plus 1 month ago, my husband negotiated the price for me to $102 (original price was $108) as Iâ€™m a long stay customer in Vodafone.  I waited for more than 4 weeks and called up today to check where is my new phone, and was been told my order has been cancelled. And the sales told me he will give a compensation to a discount price of my bill which is $102/pm because of the mistake, and I said fine as I totally forgot the deal I made 1 month ago(was already $102). After I realized the mistake I called back and was been told thatâ€™s the new contact I signed up, they canâ€™t do anything about it. Basically they tricked me into a new contact with the same price and asked me to wait for another 4-6 weeks for nothing. 
Vodafone has pool customer service and terrible coverage, not worth to stay with them at all.",1
Worst Customer Care,"Worst customer care!!! I have been with Vodafone for longtime (appr 14 years), I have three number on post paid with them. My last two years plan is $40.00 plan, which plan included $400.00 value Standard AU and International Talk & Text dan 500 MB data. Mainly used for international calls and had around 150 minutes for the country I mainly called. My first numberâ€˜s plan will end in December 16, I approached their CS discussing to upgrade my phone with the same plan. They said I can upgrade the handset but can not keep my existing $40.00 plan, I have to sign with a new $40.00 plan plus handset installment, where the inclusion only Standard AU talk/text and 1 GB data NO international Talk. I gave them a comparison from their competitor with the same handset and same plan $40.00 + $0 Upfront the plan inclusion Unlimited Standard National Calls & Text $50 Standard Intâ€™l Calls & Text 1gb Total Data 500MB + 500MB bonus. Vodafone is $7 more expensive. They could not even MATCH the plans of other providers. So I decided to move all my number to other provider.
The company really knows how to fool people and make money. They wonâ€™t look after you, no matter how long youâ€™ve been with them. 

See you Vodafone; you are not the only one in the market!!!!",2
Vodafone live to rip customers off!!,I ordered my iPhone 7 plus and it took a month to get in and while I was waiting for it to arrive Vodafone was charging me for a product I didn't even have yet. They were making me pay for the iPhone when I didn't even receive it yet!!! So if you upgrade to an iPhone and it takes 3 months to get in you'll be paying for that new phone you didn't even get yet. Worst phone company.,1
Changed phone provider,"After tpg went to Vodafone I decided to give them a try. No good, patchy coverage and constantly overcharging for I don't know what. I run out of data and I haven't changed how I use my phone. Aldi is fantastic value for money and they use the Telstra network.",1
Worst telecom provider and worst customer service,"Bought a data Sim at Sydney Airport for urgent use. Was told that it would be activated within 5 minutes. 2 hours later, still not activated. Customer service said might take up to 24 hours to activate. Called again after 7 hours as still not working. Customer service said might take 48 hours to activate. They have no idea. They sell data cards at airport and expect people can wait 24 or 48 hours before they can use them? Which century are Vodafone living in. Their service desks in India have standard answers which are totally unhelpful. Absolutely a waste of money and time.  Please don't use this network if you want good reliable service.",1
Poor customer service-need training!,"Hi,

Unfortunately, he never call me back. I did try to call him direct line more than 4 times on the same day since morning 10 am but he also never returned any of my call.


I did try to call and left message again today but still no luck!


i did email them to complain and Trish the manager also not helping!! as she confirmed thatr Tim is not in today and my order is being follow up and asked what i want to do? as there is nothing for them to do now and she believe that Tim assume its all good!!! eventhough i did try to left message couple times!


honestly, vodafone----stop using risk insure as they only employ lazy people and unprofessional

seriously, not happy with vodafone especially the insurance company!


after my contract finished, i will use OPTUS and I hope they don't use Risk Insure for the partner",1
"Terrible Network, Poor Customer service, no Technical knowledge to technicians","Terrible, could not get network in most of places during my vacation. No solutions from vodafone for technical issues.",1
Terrible network never use it or you will regret for whole life like me,"Terrible service, terrible network, I recommend never ever take Vodafone in you life. Worst decision by me to taking it as my mobile network. People are rude, charge you extra without reason. And take you for 24 months of trouble an extra charges. Just switch off phone and never use data services.",1
Horrible,I should be paying my full payment of more than 600 bec I need to go back overseas for 3 months bec its emergency but i can't pay at the shop. And they told me that they will email me where to pay. But they didn't email me for 3 months. When i come back i got a lot of notice and send my papers to adr. And now i need to pay 1069 aud.  This is not fair.,1
Scam. Dodgy. Rude,"I signed up for a mobile plan $95 few months ago. I was told that I can downgrade to any other plan any time.Plan includes $15 for a mobile as well. After two months the mobile dropped and ended up with cracked screen.Went to Vodafone shop to get it repaired. They said its not insured so they can't do anything. I said ok, since mobile cost is only $15/month so give me another mobile then. They said 'NEVER POSSIBLE'. I said, ok downgrade me to some other plan, so that I can buy another phone. They said you can only 'UPGRADE'.What the hell. Let me tell you, there are no vodafone signals at my place and I live in Bankstown.I hope vodafone is never gonna succeed with this attitude and soon be kicked out of Australia.",1
Outrageous,I had Vodafone prepaid 4 years only this morning I remembered I needed to recharge only 2 find out I lost 17g as I didn't recharge in the time. I rang Vodafone sitting on the phone forever & then get told they wouldn't credit back my data . I wouldn't recommend this phone company 2 anyone .. If it was 7g I wouldn't have minded but 17g & not one bit of compassion but no u r not getting it back .. So I'm getting it out there that I wouldn't use them EVER AGAIN,1
"Good service, long waits on hold","Overall happy with Vodafone's service and coverage, but I always have to wait on hold when I call CS. Customer Service is always helpful though when I do get through",4
Cant wait for my contract to finish to move elsewhere,"The network coverage is average, drops out near my workplace.I have a post-paid plan of $70 /mnth with 3 GB of internet which now have about 8 GB of data, but I cannot change to that because it will start a new contract. They keep adding data on to my plan and everytime I call, they say we send you sms which are never accurate (I have all the messages saved).There is no way to stop the internet access once the data allowance is reached",1
Vodafone online chat - excellent service,"I got in touch with online chat to upgrade my phone and plan. Thanks very much to Deepa, who helped me find what I needed much more easily than I could do online, instore or by phone.Very patient, courteous and helpful.",5
Waste of time,"Called up prior to going into an actual store to know I wouldn't be wasting my time, got there and was told completely different information to what I was told over the phone. Representative said ""who knows who you talked to, they don't have access to our system."" Does that mean calling up the vodafone company itself is pointless? If they ""indeed"" didn't have access to the system what is the point of having the option to call up and how is it that they can look up the very information you can? Representative treated me as if I was the stupid one, I had to explain my issue several times for her to understand me. Called up again straight after I left the store to clarify the information with a 'third' representative, he put me on hold to then have accidentally hung up on me instead. Called back and blamed the 'reception.' Left a very unhappy customer, have been with vodafone for many many years as my whole family is with vodafone. They have decent plans and it's easy since we can call voda to voda free. Decent reception majority of the time but in some areas I get no reception. Recently the reception quality has been declining. Time to change companies for sure. Customer service is great with some but appalling with others. Usually all it takes is one bad service rep to ruin your whole experience. Consider wisely when choosing this company.",1
Worst services ever,"One of the worst services ever. Was sent to 5 different vodafone outlets because my phone has been playing up. Been running around from 12pm and around 4 pm one of the staffs tells me to get letter from Samsung  (the phone i use ). I didnt have time for that as m running late for work now. So i have been running around for 4 hours, no solution given and with a phone thats not working. So am i supposed to keep my unresponsive phone. How am i supposed to work now ?Well done vodafone , simply well done !!",1
Vodafone network,Called customer service but not good response.Deciding to leave vodafone.Retention team also acknowledge problem but said only 7 calls drop.Any one have a better option.,1
New Vodafone Plan,"Vodafone has been really bad customer service to me. I have been with them for 4 years now and I always wanted the international calls in my plan as I call Sri Lanka often. But they have taken Sri Lanka off!! Really? over the past years I would just go to the store and would let them know that I want to proceed with a plan similar to my old plan with the new phone. with Vodafone I got a bill of $122 and was very unhappy and called then and then they explain to me that Sri Lanka is not included anymore.I asked them pay the amount due and leave their service for a different service provider and they tell me I have to pay $2000 to leave them. What a joke??

The customer service is the worst. I would recommend anyone to proceed with Virgin mobile. My friends have got very good deals. I have no option but to stay with vodafone now. But I am very unhappy",1
Extremely unprofessional staff pathetic customer service,"I wanted to change my plan to a casual month to month after completion of my 2 year contract. It took four attempts to resolve such a simple request. Every representative was providing misleading information. Being suspicious, on one of the calls I asked for their Employee ID for reference and she said she could not provide me anything other than her name. So I asked if it was her opinion or its Vodafone policy. She said she could not comment. Obviously they are scared of accountability and therefore do not want us to have a trace. Upon probing further she said I was being ridiculous and hung up the phone. I must mention that I was persistent but extremely cordial in my approach. I filled out a survey voicing my concerns and was never approached by anyone.

I have received worst customer service, only once in life, and that was  ""where else"" at one of Vodafone outlets. Very unprofessional and untrained staff.  I will advice everyone to stay miles away form this very shady company where transparency is just a word that means nothing.",1
Vodafone is by far the best,"We've been with Vodafone for the past Six Years with no problems, we've had both prepaid and postpaid with no problems, Their the best Telco, We have had dealings with, There is always going to be wingers no matter what.",5
Over charged! And terrible service,"In the past 2 weeks I have called Vodafone with an issue involving being over charged, first they made up a charge then said the charge was invalid now still after 2 weeks they have not fixed the issue! Terrible service! Never again! I also advise others to rethink there service providers!",1
Worst to worst customer service,"I am with Vodafone from last 2+ years and bought sony experia from them on contract for 2 years. The phone and service were good. Once my contract was over I decided to upgrade my contract and bought sony experia M5. Problems started thereafter, its one of the worst phones I have ever used. Initially there were problems with its charging, so when I took it to their CSR, he replaced it with a refurb phone. Within few days that too started having problems, as soon as I used to switch on data pack, the network used to go off. Again I went to CSR and this time too he did the same. The next refurb phone I got didn't work too, as soon as I used to make a call it used to switch off on its own. 

Fed up with all this nonsense I went back to CSR, as per their policy I am eligible to swap it with some other handset which is of same price as M5. They are not replacing the phone at all and when I go to their CSR he calls up the backend and they keep him on hold for half an hour and then say their is some technical faults in the system they cannot get hold of what sets they can offer me.

I actually feel harassed and fooled. Will never ever go or suggest anyone to go in contract with Vodafone. Worst customer service, totally unprofessional and unethical too.",1
Lousy coverage and customer service.,"Stupid me went out and  got a new phone and contract with Vodafone ,I was with them  five years ago and was dissatisfied. But believing their latest coverage claims i went back to Vodafone.Well  thier coverage and service have not changed. I  recently had major heart surgery and had to move in at my daughter's  house in sydney  west. The only way i can use my phone was to go out in the back yard or in the street.I  called their  customer service on the 5th of September and I was  told that this area is in an open air type of service meaning your phone only works outside.The stupid moron from customer service suggested  that i should simply go outside to use my phone. WHAT AN INSULT.
I said listen here i told you i had heart surgery and i am mostly bed ridden, and i insist  someone attempts  to give me a satisfactory  answer or solution. His promise was that someone  will contact me within three days no such luck.I went out and got a boost sim card                
( Telstra)and the service is excellent. My next move is the Telecoms Ombudsmans office

VODAFONE  are completely  lacking  in customer service. Keep away from them.
It is now the 2nd on November  still no callback.
I now sent an email  and  will follow through with  the ombudsmans  office if they don't  reply.",1
WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!!,"Ordered a phone and they sent the wrong one. Told me to decline the delivery. Asked for help on what to do next. The CSRs are very rude!! Haven't received the phone order and didn't manage to help or even try to resolve the problem but instead they kept on passing me to different people saying the same things and then got disconnected multiple times and they never bother to call back!!! I was given a date and time by the csr herself, I waited but she never called, again. CSRs are very hard to understand, talked really fast and won't even bother to answer a question when asked, just kept on talking gibberish!!! Will never renew again!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
Worst phone company!,I wouldn't touch these guys with a 10 foot barge poll! I paid a debt in full with them & they left it as unpaid on my credit rating for a whole before changing it to paid. Be very aware that if you make 1 mistake with vodafone your entire credit history can be destroyed.,1
Good pay as you go package for an overseas visitor,"Great value for 30 dollars a month, free Australia calls and texts, plus 2gb download. Much better than we can get with Vodafone uk! Extremely helpful staff in the local Vodafone shop, swapped the sim for us, set up the iPhone and checked the international call charges for us. Top up is easy, would  like this in the UK....",4
Vodafone is the WORST provider ever. Speaking from experience.,They have one of the worst service ever! I have been with Vodafone for several years and they could not even MATCH the plans of other providers. I was being lured into a Sim ONLY $45 dollar plan for 24 months. It was a mistake.,1
"crap, dont go with vodafone","they change your contract or plan at any time..it is a crap, they lure you first and then change their plans",1
Much better customer service and price than Telstra,"I signed up with Vodafone about 2 1/2 years ago. Was on $130/month plan with Telstra and had trouble dealing with customer service so thought i would change. Have found the customer service with Vodafone miles better. Easier to get through, they call you back and they sort things out. Same unlimited plan with phone costs $70/month. Am very happy i switched.",4
Biggest mistake ever.,"Never go on a plan with Vodafone, I made a mistake by signing up on a plan and wanted to change it within a week and didn't even give me a chance to. I asked if I go cancel and still didn't allow me to. Never go with Vodafone they'll just rip you off.",1
Are you mad to use vodafone,I wanted to upgrade my vodaphone plan which was more than 2 years and they said that i cannot upgrade because they dont have any international countries call except the few countries. 21st century it shoud be easier to connect families and friends overseas because but vodafone downgrading the technology. So overseas people from poor countries cannot use vodaphone???? Question to vodaphone?? Good luck,1
They crap company,So today my phone was restricted because I haven't paid money for a bit so I call up to pay and set with date for another payment and so what they do they tell me I need to go to store to verify that that's me what the hell.I give you the passport number and my credit card how can it not be me??!Very crap company leaving them.,1
THE WORST APPLICATION AND WEBSITE,"Vodafone is good in customer service. Indians are trying to make you happy overtime you call them .Problem is their website and phone application. You can't download old bills from internet, wait for minutes to access application. Their IT team needs to be sacked and develop new website and application... that is usable!",2
Poor/limited network coverage,Network coverage is so poor in my area that it is unbelievable and yet Vodafone claims it has good coverage in my postcode area on their website. Do not waste time with Vodafone.,1
Worst customer care ever,"I have been a Voda customer for years,good coverage, but  Their customer service department in india. Thay keeps me holding  more than 15 minutes for resolving issues, but problems not been solved, they looks scams ,Not any more!",1
worst ever.,I have been a vodafone customer fora long time they made me hate my life. they are permanent headache. never go on contract with them it really sucks .,1
"Excellent coverage, exceptional customer service",Since being with vodaphone for 2 years I've never had one issue with coverage. The Vodafone staff are always exceptionally helpful.Prior to changing to Vodafone I had heard bad reviews however my experience has been a great one.,5
Cheated by sales rep,The sales rep from Vodafone at Westfield Knox conned one of my family members to sign us up for another 12 month plan which costs way more than the plan from Vaya. This is not worth the value of my money for the next twelve months and worst customer service I have ever experienced. This is not acceptable Vodafone. Please get your act together and do something about this.,1
vodacrud,"I have been a vodafone customer fora long time. Dragged kicking and screaming from 3, i persisted due to their cheaper price they offered me (little did i know they would alter after a few months) finally after the constantly poor coverage, poor customer service, my data use suddenly started spiking, even though i had not changed my internet usage, and had wifi turned on at home, so this should have reduced my usage not increased. meanwhile my mobile was just registering that i had only used half of my data. In My last bill i was charged an extra $50 for apparently going an extra 50meg over. I looked at other phone contracts and noticed vodafone was not competitive when optus was offering 10 gig for $40 and telstra was offering 7gig for $40. 5 bucks more expensive than my pissy 1gig contract that constantly went over its limit? And far better coverage? The choice was obvious. See ya vodafone. I certainly won't miss you.",1
Reception,"The network still has reception issues, even in the Sydney CBD. Contacted Vodafone about leaving the network, after I made the switch from Optus (as I wanted the $5 roaming). Was told that I was one day out for the network guarantee (my bad). Now stuck with Vodafone for the full 12 months, without reception at home or work. I get frequent call drop outs too (when I actually have reception), something I never had with Optus.",1
Note 7 return,"An attempt to return my (explosive )Samsung Note 7 to Tweed Mall was unsuccessful after two attempts and a phone call to their 1333 customer support number.When I was finally able to speak to a person on 1555 she was the wrong person.A second call resulted in a lady who told me to return to the Tweed Mall store and that she would leave a note on my account to allow me to leave the phone for a full refund.The Tweed Mall store, where I bought the phone,  told me that I would have to take the phone to Robina ???Although a long term Vodafone customer , the term has now finished.
 Avoid at all costs.
After a trip to Robina and numerous Customer Support emails the full refund was received so I have updated my review to 2 stars.
Thank you Customer Support",2
Don't lead customers up the garden path,"Vodafone said they could unlock my old phone. They ran me around in so many circles I'm still recovering from the dizziness. That was their game all the time. They state in the email that their policy is to send the phone away and get it unlocked if there is no success. I know you had a marginal attempt at helping but in the end, no answer on emails from [name removed] on the unlocking team when he just put it in the too hard basket. Lots of talk and misleading service with no results.",1
False promises and wastage of time,Think twice if you are going to buy a Vodafone mobile phone contract because,1
Data rip off,"Vodafone prepaid is so much more expensive than other providers, i was paying $30 a month with a other provider, I move to Vodafone last month, but big mistake that was, most providers let you roll over your data, but not Vodafone.Last month data bill $80 and other provider only cost $30 a month, doing the same thing.I am going back to another provider to save money, instead of giving it to Vodafone and getting nothing for your money.",1
Overseas $5 deal it worth a cracker,In bali they only have 1 of 5 good roaming providersIt's but Hutcheson3Even poor people don't use this as there is less than 10 % cover geographicallyIt's a jokeAnd they dead bat you when you ask,1
Appalling customer service,"I have been a loyal customer with Vodafone for many years. I am currently on a 2yr mobile phone contract. Customer service used to be very good. Until I received by last bill, charging me extra for data. I checked my data use on the Vodafone app 15min before the end of the billing period and I had a few hundred MB left. Low and behold I get the bill and their added data without my permission and I apparently have used over the data limit. I rang customer service and got asked all these personal details by this smart aleck Indian. He then had the cheek to say he couldn't help me, he then had the cheek to send me a message to my mobile that he couldn't confirm my identity. If this is so why did he send such a message.I am absolutely appalled by this service. Where do they get these incompetents from. No stars. If people have issues with them go to the TELCO OMBUDSMAN.",1
poor customer service.,worse service provider in the market. I've been with them 8 years and my payment bounced back once and they charged my fees for that. when i spoke to their help desk they are useless and rude. going to cancel my service as no point to be with such a company when they cannot help you.,1
"Dishonest, incompetent &amp; downright atrocious","I ordered a mobile broadband device 2 weeks ago to arrive 2-3 days later. I am still waiting. I have been told many different stories by many different people. No-one there knows which was is up. Their systems are non-existent or broken. Sales promised me that support was provided only by Hobart between 8-8, which I relied on heavily in my decision. Although I have received various stories on that too, it turns out it isn't the case. I had the most appalling experiences with Vodafone in Mumbai. Then no-one could find me in their 'system', so I couldn't speak to anyone. It turns out I did have an account, but Vodafone 'forgot' to tell me. They forgot to tell me the number and of some extremely important terms and conditions to which I would never have agreed had I known about them. The terms and conditions are so far in favour of the Telcos that they have no liability for anything, but the customer is still obliged to pay. They lied numerous times, verbally and in writing, about numerous issues. They then lost my online complaints. By this time, I had spoken to over 10 different people, was stressed and reduced to floods of tears by their attitudes and behaviours and sheer frustration. They refused to rectify the situation, refused to take legal and moral responsibility for their behaviours. After an enormously long conversation, they offered me $90, half of what I was planning to pay in one month and not even covering my direct financial cost of the delay in device delivery, let alone anything else. And they simply said if I didn't like it, I could go to the TIO. Again, making the customer do everything and be more inconvenienced and stressed. It was also clear that they felt they wouldn't get into trouble from the TIO. That's what you get when you have an industry funded and operated Ombudsman. What I have had to ensure simply beggars belief. If someone in another profession or sector, such as law, medicine, building, trades, had behaved even a tenth as badly, they'd be facing huge fines, lose their licences and possibly be facing other sanctions. Do not go anywhere near them.",1
Vodafone covers 96 % - DONT THINK SO,"In the town of 1770 - Agnus Waters in Queensland - Zilch Coverage - Nada, Nothing - Telsta, Optus brilliant, one lady actually gave me her mobile to make a phone call, not too many people like that around. Vodafone brag about their 96% coverage in Australia, we are in a very popular tourist area, but nothing much changes if you are not in a major centre, they are absolutely useless. 96% In their dreams - meanwhile we are left with no service",1
Inability to resolve diputes,"The manager of the resolutions call centre states ""there is nothing I can do"", so I ask for to be transferred to someone who can - there is no one else evidently. I have a reference number so I asked ""so if there is no one who can help me with this what do I do with the reference number? "" He doesn't know...hopefully the TI Ombudsman will as I have been charged an extra $600 for excess data usage with not apparent reason and no notification that we were close to our limit. This wrought has to stop.",1
Poor customer service,"Four months short of 2 year contract & phone not working ( has already been repaired once). Went into store last week told we needed to go home & call customer service to get a new contract once the account was swapped from my name to my sons name. Told on the phone that they could reduce $200 pay out fee to $58 if we agreed to sign up for a $58 month plan. Was then transferred to an off shore call center to organize contract. Very difficult to hear & understand & turns out they never organized a new contract or phone. Back in store today & staff noted nothing written in notes about this. When I mentioned it was difficult to understand the call center staff the woman in the store told me I offended her because her background was the same country as the call centre. What!!!! I never said anything offensive. She had a terrible attitude then said we had to go home and call again with a sulky attitude. This has been done, they won't honor the $58 payout despite being told that was what we were originally told, its $200, even though my son had signed for 2 more years. Rip off service, poor customer service. Avoid Northland store in Victoria. Appears in store staff will only direct you to call from home, can't or won't help you resolve anything in store. Glad my phone is with another service provider.",1
Terrible service,I got a phone on a plan when home and went to activate the phone when I found the volume button was not working it was stuck. I took it in to the store only to be to told in a rude manner it was not there problem. I then took it to another store. The staff member tried to fix the button but couldn't. I took it back to the same store three times before they would send it in for repairs. Three weeks later no phone customer care couldn't help the store said it takes times. Finally I got the phone and was told there was a scratch on it and it was not there problem. I contact customer service and was told if I cared. My phone was in store two weeks ago. No told me. Then I was told that Vodafone don't make the phone's so they have no responsibility for it. Then she said you. Broke it didn't you she was rude they refuse to help me I was told there are many customers and you are. The first complaint and if not happy cancel the contract and pay the fees and leave. I will be contacting the ombudsman don't ever go to Vodafone staff are rude and unhelpful they are happy to take your money but will not help you.,1
Disgusting,Not only do they rip you off on coverage but their internet/mobile data is a joke and if it's not their fault supposedly it's your phones. These guys take advantage of people every day and they rip people off and this needs to stop.  MOVE TO ANOTHER COMPANY. These guys are outright sold out and use Indian call centres. They also allow you to get dodgy phone calls from false/fake companies. This is the worst telecomm companies in the world and they are shameless about being a con job. I am never going to trust Vodafone again they just don't care about anyone AVOID AT ALL COSTS if you don't want to lose out on your money.,1
Is there no decent organisation left?,"So Vodafone decided to change my password without my consent had someone call and tell me that I had changed my password in 2014. The thing is that is when I started this account. They gave me the date I started the account and said my password was changed on that date.I have been overcharged for months. My regular monthly payments are $72.80, however I am rarely charged that amount. I receive two to three sms saying that I will be charged $10 per gig the bill howevr reaches between $120 and $160 on most occasions this happens ren if my mobile data is switched off for days.
After over a year of this, I wanted to access my bills when it asks me to enter my 4 digit password and when I do it says invalid pin.
For some reason they don't want me to access my bills. When I call to have this rectified I once was told that my pin was wrong and when I called back and spoken to several people in the Indian call centre in various occasions, they confirmed that my pin is correct and went on to discuss my issue. They said they would reset my 4 digit pin, but every time I get off the phone I receive 6 digit password, I call back and explain I only need the 4 digit pin and they assure me that this would happen and they send me a 6 digit password which does not work.
I have been back and forth for almost a month and I was final assured that I would receive last 5 bills via email within 24-48 hours and days in I didn't receive any email from Vodafone. 
The only emails I receive without fail is that they will process my account for payment and nothing else.
On multiple occasions I asked to be put through to the complaints department or email address. They say that there is no such department. What? An organisation without appropriate escalation channels? 
I then emailed the TIO after I have been messed about by this so called organisation for a long time. They then care all of the sudden and send an email with the bills I was supposed to have received a while ago.
I also receive a call from someone claiming to be from complaints department. I thought they didn't have a complaint department, did it suddenly appear.
They had charged me thousands of dollars and they didn't even give me the service to reflect that or any service for that matter. Now this person calls and tells me that my pin was changed at the time I created it.

The most unbelievable useless company ever,"The worst customer service I have ever experienced, ever.Not only did I have to wait 7.48 min to get through the useless prompts, but have been on hold for a further 11 min. I have asked this poor excuse for a company for an old statement. I have called them 7 times, visited 3 stores after that's what they said to I am still at square one. On Friday was told I would get a letter emailed and it would take 72 hours to turn around, heard nothing for 4 days, so called them again same hold time, etc. when I spoke to someone internationally they where rude and very abrupt. I had to go through to a supervisor [name removed] and [name removed] in Australia who where most friendly and helpful.
Finally after 2 weeks got what I wanted.

How is videophone still operating as a phone provider astounds me....

I am no longer with them and all this confirms that I made the right decision...
VODAPHONE actually should be dubbed - worst company in the world.",1
"Terrible Customer Service, Awful billing calculation specially for Data!",They are good just for sales step.,1
Useless,I am a business owner and always ask customer to feel free to contact me if there is anything that my staff or I have done that may not be to their satisfaction and try best to rectify...customer is always right!! I hate seeing bad reviews about my business but most importantly hate leaving bad reviews about any business as it can destroy a business but Vodafone has left me no choice but to vent out. I signed up for 18GB Wireless broadband $60 and 10GB phone $50 and was told that data would be shared to my surprised I received a bill with extra charge for exceeding 10GB on my phone (only used 6Gb on broadband) so I phoned and spoke to a very rude women who told me that nothing she could do and that I had to pay the bill and when I asked to speak to a manager she said no that she was the manager so just pay the bill. I wrote them an email explaining what had happen and they call me back no apology for they I was treated and worst of told me that nothing could be done if I wanted to have shared I would have to change my plan which would for higher fee and less GB...never again and I hope that read all this review and do something about it.,1
Scammers,Make sure you read any contracts before signing. They are full of cons.Worst customer service I have ever dealt with. Basically broken English speaking bullies.,1
Vodafone has improved,"I have been with Vodafone for more than 5 years now and I should say they have improved a lot. I too had some issues but all of them were sorted out professionally. Though I should agree, there are some customer representatives who are rude sometimes and don't want to help.",5
Nothing but a joke,Been with them for a while and already a common misconception is their data services. Although you may think it's good it isn't. The face of the matter is if you have bad internet and their towers aren't strong enough. They lie and blame it on your phone they are completely rude and offset to rip you off in every way possible. Not to mention when you post the truth on their FB and you post the truth they will BAN you and I mean literally BAN you from their FB. This company is a joke and I would avoid steering away from these con artists.,1
exremely unsatesfaied after they excluded Iran from thier international call,"I am really disappointed because Vodafone recently excluded Iran from their all plans and it was the only way I could call my brother who has leukemia and my dad who's extremely sick .I have to leave Vodafone after 5 years being with them, so sad.",1
"Been lied to, put on hold &amp; randomly transferred, and hung up on, still no working sim more than 2 w","Voda is a joke, worst customer service from any company ever! No one takes responsibility when something goes wrong. Don't ever go with them, as the cheap price is certainly not worth the bad service & stress they put you through!",1
Service great / plans that add extra data.,You have no say when your data is ready to expire as to not wanting extra data. Not good when you can't afford the data - prepaid is my choice at the end of this plan.Disappointing.,5
Forcing customers to change their plan,"I had a plan ($50 red sim only) about a year and I was satisfied with it till two months ago I got an email which says we're going to move you to a new plan. The payment was still the same as y previous one and had more data as a bonus. But there was a big problem. I had my first plan because it included international call about 300 minutes that was really good. But with the new plan they'd removed the country I always call so the whole thing is useless.I've found out they're targeting those customers who spend most of their call and data and trying to force them to change their plan or leave Vodafone. 
I'm not happy at all because it's nonsense. I'm paying for that plan and I have the right to spend the data and 300 minutes the call value. Do they expect us to pay and not spend???
I ported my sim to TPG and would never come back to Vodafone again.",1
No Network,"The basic thing we expect from vodafone is to get Network coverage in and around the city. I live 18km from Perth CBD and in densely populated suburb but I can't get Network coverage in my house. I spoke to customer care in April and they promised me they are working on it and adding new towers which will resolve the issue by July. We are in Aug and no improvement. I called them again and they said they have upgraded their towers and if I am still not getting network in my house then too bad. They don't have any plans to add more tower. I think they are giving their customers crap about their upgrade place. How is it possible that the tower was added in my suburn and I still get ""Emergency Services only"" on my phone. I think its time to say good bye and move on to something better.",1
Absolutely will change network this is a unreliable network.,"Network very poor newport queensland, just transferred 3 mobile numbers to vodafone prepaid and promised to be activated in 30 minutes. 4 hours later still nothing plus you can't activate your account till you get an sms on your phone unlike optus and telstra they email you but vodafone won't do that. Customer service staff are not very clear at speaking the English language. I will be removing the 3 numbers to another network very soon.",1
Dreadful Mistake Going To Vodafone For Internet,"Decided to change from Telstra to wireless wifi with Vodafone. I did this over the phone at the same time as I was quoted 18GB per month for $65.00. What I've actually got is 15GB for $60.00. I was billed for this service as soon as I applied despite not receiving the wifi router until about 3 weeks later. On the phone the other day to pay my bill and I had real difficulty understanding the person I was speaking to who, from what I could understand, was telling me I owed $100.00 for the internet and $50.00 for the phone. I repeatedly said I should only be paying $60.00 for internet and $30.00 for phone. I asked to speak to someone in Australia and was refused. I eventually hung up. Phone rang and it was an extremely respectful, well spoken individual on the other end who sorted out my queries; this after spending a good 30 minutes on the phone prior.

By the way, the internet coverage is LOUSY.",1
2-3 days delivery for SIM card turns into 12 days,"I bought a value SIM card starter pack for a trip back to Australia to visit my family for 1 month. Confirmation email said it would be delivered in 2-3 days. At 6 day mark I receive an email saying that it will be delivered 12 days after my order date! I call Vodafone to get a refund because I am in desperate need of a SIM card. They tell me, my only option is to go into a store and buy another SIM card pack! Seriously, the worst. I don't know what I was thinking because I was with them in the past and they have terrible coverage too.",1
Worst mobile service I've ever used,"Bad reception, post paid, fair, customer service the worst I've ever had, 3 hours to get a response, 8 months no service only offered to give a $100.00 discount? After spending $230.00 in fees? Lousy service would never recommend ever.",1
"Vodafail Vodaphony Avoidafone, take your pick.","I left Telstra(never to return no matter how bad the others are!!!) & went to Vodafone as they were a little better(livable/usable) for coverage where I live on the Sunshine Coast. Since they changed to 4G the reception has dropped off a cliff!! They had some initial troubles with the 4G changeover which took weeks to fix(way too long) & things did improve a little but the service has never come back to being as good as it was on 3G. Now in the last 4 to 5 weeks it has become completely useless again when trying to use the phone inside. Admittedly I do live in an area that all the telcos seem to struggle with(sort of hilly area) but in this day & age with the way we need phones to survive(I work from home & need to use the phone constantly) & the way they shove them down our throats you would think that in the very populated area where I live that reception problems would have been sorted out years ago!!! I've rung multiple times to complain to their call centre (in India of course) which I find so infuriating. A HELP LINE IS NO HELP IF THEY CAN'T HELP YOU!!! Lets please clarify before I get called a racist. The call centre people do their best & it is not their fault that companies farm out the work overseas & that it's pointless talking to them. There is no way in hell that I should be talking to people from another country that can't understand me very well & I can't understand them very well. They are obviously reading like a robot from a computer screen prompting their replies & they don't/can't understand local lingo/problems just the same as I wouldn't be much help to them if I was working in an Australian call centre helping them with their local problems from India. IF YOU SELL A PRODUCT IN AUSTRALIA, SERVICE IT FROM AUSTRALIA!!! When I bought my new phone & service last year I was told(lied to) that on my plan I would always talk to people in Australia which was the condition I changed to them. I've been told with recent calls to them that I would be called back within 72 hours, didn't happen. I did find on the Vodafone site that they share Telstra mobile towers in some areas & I would be willing to bet the are using a Telstra one in my area which would explain the problem as Telstra is worse than useless. As soon as I can get out of this contract I will swap to Southern Phone which has had all my landline/internet stuff for years now with no dramas whatsoever. As long as the call centre for their mobile service is in Australia like the rest I have with them(they advertise this fact & pride themselves on it as they know it's the single biggest bugbear consumers have with telcos-overseas call centres) they will have me for life! VODAFONE=USELESS.",1
Phone coverage is a joke,"I live in a suburb of Perth approx 1 km from a 4G tower. You would think the service would be good.Most of the time the phone registers ""No Service"". Inside the house we cannot send an SMS. Have to go out onto the road to send and then it goes only occasionally. The service is basically nonexistant. We are in the process of changing to another provider. We have contacted them about this but to no avail.  Stay away at all costs.",1
Awful customer service,Their customer service is worst in the industry.  The guys in store are morons. They don't understand anything. Vodafone has outsourced their insurance to a terrible company called riskinsure. Overall keep away from this company.,1
The worst system for billing,"I have finished my contract with vodafone and transferred my number on to carrierpaid all my final bills however they have charged me bills twice after I have left their service and I had to ring back twice to resolve the issues and waiting for 15-35 mins on phone.First time they charged me incorrectly they have credited it back to me after I spoke to them say that this will never happen again 2 months after that they sent me another bill.2nd time was the same issue saying I have balance due.Changing the words around giving me different reasons each time I speak to them and telling me they will give 50% off for the balance due, they hung up the phone on me saying they will ring me back.
Then now telling me to paid back. 
They have resolved it by listening to previous call conversations and confirmed that it was mistake of his co workers incorrect information that was given to me.
I had stress of 2 hours call and they interrupted my talking and at times when I got upset told me ""ok continue, continue yeh?"" and not paying attention to my conversation. 
Worst customer service ever.",1
Really bad customer service,Bad customer service . Employes do not know their responsibility . Always give wrong information . Every employe has different views not any Terms and conditions.i upgraded my plan and ordered new handset . I got one phone after two days and second could not receive until three weeks when I called Vodafone they put on enquiry with Australia post at last I received my phone after a month and it turned out Vodafone wrote my previous address where I lived before and Vodafone kept saying it was Australia post mistake. Would not recommend Vodafone to anyone.seroiusly Vodafone u should not exist in country like Australia.,1
Go away vodafone,Really bad service they provide to me its was just regarding my postpaid sim card which was finished by its contract and they put me on month to month contract without letting me know and after 3 months I got overdue amount of $540 which I have to pay otherwise they harm my credit history..,1
Useless waste of money,Terrible coverage in a capital Australian city. Can't even send a text in my home. Fed up with promises of improvement. Woeful service.,1
New Vodafone plan trap,Was a Vodafone customer for 4 years $50 plan. Mainly used for international calls and had around 150-180 minutes for the country I mainly phoned. Now they automatically assign me to a $50 plan month to month with 90 minutes international calls and all they have to tell me is sorry we no longer have the previous plan. Replacing the international minutes benefit with  4GB data which I do not need at all. Seriously Vodafone. Go to hell!,1
The worst customer support service in Fremental store,"I am trying to make an international call today to a number which I have called on Monday, it does not work now. I go to vodafone store in Fremantle, the guy named Tim did not give me any help. He said it is the number problem, I ask him call the number using his mobile, it can work correctly. Then he said my phone must be blocked by that number. He said it is NOT vodafone's problem rudely, they never try to solve the problem, they only want charge money.",1
Not doing as they state,I entered  a new contract with vodafone its been 2 weeks im not happy with service . I asked to get out of contract as they state you have 30 days to terminate but i was declined im not allowed . Its only bee 14 days since i entered a new contract  what a scam Vodafone  has going dont trust them go to a different  provider save yourself the headache dont trust them.,1
The worst!,Big waste of time and money.Would never recommend it to anyone.Worst network and highest bills.The company really knows how to fool people and make money.,1
Not living up to providing service,So signed up to a new contract phone and tablet under the sales pitch of great 4g reception in cranbourne east area. Yet im paying over my monthly due because im exceeding ny data usuage funny thing is ive no connection/reception when at home where i try to do my net surfing. In short im paying for a service im not recieving. No its not unique to my phone. This affects my tablet. And also my wifes prepaid phone. All with Vodafone. And the only thing they say is upgrades or maintenace or we did a site investigation and all appears fine. If it were fine i wouldnt be this frustrated that i have taken it up to the telco ombudsman.,1
Worse Crap Reception Ever,"This is the worse phone company ever! I get 0 reception anywhere I go it drives me insane and makes me want to shoot myselfWhoever owns or runs vodaphone is a stupid crapI hate it so muchPlease to everyone who is thinking to get vodaphone, dont!!! Its crapping horrible",1
Customer Service From Hell!,Warning!!!! Very Bad Company to deal with!!!Customer Service team are mainly Indians who got no idea about Australian Customers!Local outlets have young kids running it-inexperienced!,1
I Hate Vodafone com au,I created this page because I'm truly fed up with the customer service I have been receiving from Vodafone wasting my time and never resolving the issue only saying is that they are extremely sorry.,1
Duped into signing a contract,Vodafone sales called me on a busy day and tricked me into accepting a contract for the same plan i was earlier on. Next time the sales guy call be attentive to their terms and conditions.,1
Promises promises......,They make promises and then never keep them. The customer service there is nothing but a joke. Disappointment and frustration is all you will get if you need them.,1
Worst customer service!,"The customer service is just hopeless. Really hopeless!As long as you don't need to contact them it's ok, but if you do: You're screwed!",1
"Excess data fees, terrible customer service","I've been with Vodafone for 5 years and I'm finally making the switch over to another carrier. The coverage has been great in Sydney and Wollongong, and I can rarely fault this.ck it up and pay the excess or keep checking your account to keep a track of your data. However, your data usage isn't updated regularly, it'll still be 18 hours out of date, so even if you are responsible, you'll still pay excess. They'll also try and sting you into upgrading to another plan. Optus will charge you a one-off $10 1GB top-up if you go over your limit, but Vodafone refuse to offer a similar service. You're instead asked to pay the excess fees with the option of an additional $10 1GB top-up as well. 

It's also become increasingly difficult to contact Vodafone. The website used to direct you to a phone number or web form. Now they try and steer you through FAQs and it becomes an hour's exercise to find a way to speak to someone, which is usually through Twitter and absolutely pointless.",1
I would give Vodafone zero stars!!,I paid cash for a $50 pre paid card at Brisbane airport only to find I had zero coverage in Tallebudgera. I told them I would use the phone in an area in Melbourne also and they said it would not work there either.  I tried for over an hour asking for a refund due to the lack of service and was told it would not be possible. I should have checked these reviews before I became a victim of Vodaphone.  This is definately a buyer beware phone company that should have the integrity to at least inform customers about their lack of reception in nso many areas. But why would they when they can rip people off instead?,1
The worst,"I started with Vodafone in 2014 and at the start all was fine. After quite a few months I started being charged for extra data that I wasn't even using because my data is always turned off unless i needed it to quickly check something but it was never enough for me to go over. THEN nearing the end of 2015 my bill was charge at almost double what it was supposed to be and I wasn't using anything extra!! In light of this I decided to switch to Virgin in mid January 2016. I paid my final bill to Vodafone and then I was charged for this final bill AGAIN 2 weeks later!!! 6 months on and they are STILL emailing my final bill to me which I ALREADY PAID! Would not recommend at all, customer service is also useless at best!",1
Vodafone was great ten years ago,"So totally agree with you, my son's 8GB and I data usage has always been under than what we're allowed but since I cancelled the insurance on our phones we've been hit with an extra ""data usage"" that one of us has agreed to, not, and upon querying this it takes two months to take it off their system and you have to pay for it...go figure. Having been a Vodafone customer for 15 years a phone was lost through Australia Post or Vodafone last November, I was treated like a criminal through customer service and their local store and finally had to go through the Ombudsmen to get a outcome. No-one got back to me if they located the phone or not. What an insult. Vodafone as soon as my son's & I contract end  we're done. Glad to see the back of you after 15 years..",1
"rubbish network, gang of liars and theives","Postpaid and prepaid Coverage is non existent, no calls out, no calls in, if we had to call an ambulance for an emergency we would die, rubbish network.",1
Worst website ever/connection always slow at certain times of the day,"I have never had so many issues with a website in my life. Every second day it's down, which is a nightmare when you need to check your download limits. Seriously, I would expect an internet service provider to actually have a decent website. The other problem is that during the after work hours the connection is sluggish. I'm in Narre Warren so it's not like I'm in the middle of nowhere. I honestly got a better connection in Numurkah. There are far better deals out there now anyway. Once my contract is up I'll be switching. Very disappointed.",2
Poor coverage in just next suburb of Sydney CBD,It is just 10 km approx from Sydney CBD but the network is like dead most of the time.No improvement although I mentioned the issues since last few months.Lost job as My jobwas reliable on the phone call.Now they suggested to terminate the service paying hand set cost as its already 3 months. I told them I am ready to drop them the handset since I been complaining last 2 months but no progress at all. Waste of time calling to them and mentioning issues again and again.Want to get rid of this headache.How can I lead it to fair trade please suggest....!,1
Works where I live,Network is quite reliable in the inner suburbs and I am forced to use Telstra when I am travelling as no one can match their coverage.But Vodafone is excellent value for money. Got my sim only plan when there was a promotion. $50 for unlimited calls in Australia and overseas and 11GB of 4G data.Customer service over the phone and in store sucks but the live chat is a good option. Looks the like the live chat team comprises of experienced staff,4
Terrible coverage in three state capitals,"This is my first product review but I'm so over vodafone and sick of not being able to use my phone.  I'm on Vodafone prepaid and the coverage is useless, now living in Perth after moving from Melbourne and it's even worse - same when I visited Sydney. A lot of days people can't call me, and I can't call them because I've got no reception. Data coverage isn't great either, i have a new Samsung galaxy but so rarely get on 3g/4g it makes me wonder if it exists.Network coverage checker on their site must be a bad joke- it always says I should get good call reception and 4g coverage indoors when I enter my address and device, but I don't get either. If it wasn't for my WiFi I'd be unable to use the Internet to post this! My family are with other networks and never have an issue.",1
Stealing from customers won't make you rich.,"Bad customer service, as well they are so quick to charge you extra but take forever to fix issues.",2
Misinformation regarding coverage,"Internet ok. Phone out ok. I have lost contact with friends simply becauce they cannot contact me? 90% of my inbound calls get diverted to voice mail. Even emergancy calls, Vodafone calls, Family  members. No help from Vodafone just crap answers. We are looking into it? 14 months and still looking. Im getting some carrier pidgin they should work?",2
Misinformation regarding coverage,It even became more confused for Vodafone. No one comunicates within the system. They agreed to terminate my contract? No compensation for the failures to abide by the contract. Then they tried to charge me for the whole cotract after agreeing to $200 termination and me keeping the phone. Just a complete pack of idiots or crooks?,2
Bad customer care and coverage,"Worst customer care and very bad coverage, when I called them regarding low coverage, they replied that you will get good coverage only on the address you have bought your phone and they cannot guarantee good coverage on other areas. Do I need to stay inside my house for 24hrs to get a phone coverage. They don't have any sense what they tell and ask for. I won't recommend them for any one.",1
Terrible coverage in regional Australia,"Vodafone has terrible reception throughout regional Australia. If your outside capital cities, then no service, hopeless. Vodafone sucks never ever go with Vodafone the suck.",1
Unreliable Special Investigator team and unhelpful phone customer service,"Congratulation Vodafone, you took my virginity on writing a product review.I have been explaining my case to 3 different staffs but all of them failed to see my value as being one of their loyal and someone who brought much profit to their company. (I am with their most expensive plan but I almost never used their phone =  a customer who brings high revenue but Low Expense for Vodafone).

My case was that someone (without my consent and I do not know who) overused my phone data by 20 GB or $200 and I have to pay that with $50 discount after my 1.5 hours wasted on the phone. 
My phone was always with me, locked and the tethering was locked as well. They simple concluded that I overused the data without considering the possibility of my phone was getting breached by other party.

My contract will end this September and I will never return to Voda for their overpriced and ungrateful customer service.

Optus seems to give better value these days.

Interesting Fact: I have 2 friends, one owns a vodafone shop (somewhere in Sydney CBD area) and one is a shop who is licensed to sale vodafone (in the Sydney northern suburbs). Both of them are trying hard to sell their company because their shop are both heavily declining in sales and profit. Because you are overpriced and unhelpful. 
Even your licensees are running away from you.

Written by some random guy in the internet (but my bad customer service and 2 shops selling are really happening)",1
Voda fail!,"I am a very disgruntled Vodafone customer! Today I was advised when I called to pay my bill that is normally 220 dollars per my contract with Vodafone that my bill actually came to $1,500.00!!!! This is the 4th month in a row that my bill was astronomical! I queried this as always because I had previously always been advised that it was a billing issue and they would rectify it.. However today I was told it's not a billing issue and this is how much I owe because I have gone over my data by $1500!!! When I asked how this is possible I was not given a straight answer, when I asked them to look into the bill i was told that the bill is correct and I have to pay this in full.. I explained to her I was never advised that I was over using my data as people I know receive text messages etc she said its my responsibility to check and not there's to notify me... Firstly how can someone who uses there phone like any other normal person use 1500 dollars worth of data that is just beyond me! I have tried to call again this evening to have this looked into and was put on hold for half and hour waiting for a manager! The service is disgusting I am a paying customer!! I have been with Vodafone for years! How could it be that this treatment is acceptable!! Disgusting behaviour from Vodafone! I expect to hear back from Vodafone this evening or I will be contacting consumer affairs and the telecommunications ombudsman as of tomorrow!",1
terrible customer service,"Everytime I call the customer service for my issues, they seems like don't know anything. I have plan with it, but they gave wrong information that made me agitated. The signal is not good.. The credit doesn't reduce straight away after we use it",1
Worst customer service,Worst ever!  I was asking why we are already charged when i havent received the phone at all..i havent used it and the bill has already started 11 jan-8/02/2021. He said that it is their policy to charge the customer in advance.  What the hell? It wasnt my problem that the handset isn't available.. His excuse there are customer who receive the box but never opened thus the bill already starting. He also advised me my phone is still for delivery but it is part of their terms and conditions that the bill would start.,1
Vodafone charges,"Watch you mobile phone charges with Vodafone if you dial up 121 , premium charges for this are $1.30 per minute and $3.10 connection , my 4 second call was $4.40 , cant imagine if i needed this service and it was a 20 minute call with them.",1
Very bad network,Vodafone one of the worst service provider in Australia. Don't signup. Better to stick with other service providers. Will switch soon,1
Incorrect credit default,"Two months ago we applied to refinance our home loan but were told we couldn't proceed as Vodafone had a default against my husband's name. My husband and I have never and will never have an account with Vodaphone, yet it was up to us to prove it was not our account. After getting the police involved, completing a stat dec and jumping through all their hoops we finally proved the account did not belong to us yet still to this day Vodafone have not removed the black mark from our credit rating. We can not gain finance until this is done and Vodafone will not allow us to talk to anyone. They should be liable and accountable for this. The police informed us that Vodafone allowed someone to use my husband's name and date of birth and issued them an account without any identification. This should be illegal. And yet, we are the ones being punished. Disgusting service Vodafone!! we will never deal with you!!",1
Armadale shopping city Vodafone store,"The male at the counter is extremely rude,he shouted at me and had all those around just stare at me",1
Rubbish reception,Never have I had a carrier so useless when it comes to reception. I am in the middle of Canberra and the service is 3rd world. I signed up to Kogan not seeing they use vodafone for their provider which was my bad but I've lasted 23 days into a 90 day contract. NEVER EVER again.,1
phone upgrade,"Been trying to upgrade phone for last 2 month. Multiple calls, chats with vodefone spend over a day with support team and no one helped me in addition to that whenever you go out of the city you have no reception so its very limited network. I got 2 mob plans and NBN with them and looking for more reliable provider. Would not recommend Vodefone.",1
I would give it 0 stars if it were an option,They overcharge for mobile plans. They gave me a mobile plans on higher than market price and they added loyalty discount on top of it to make it the same price as the market price. The only problem is that they expected me to pay the overcharged market price (excluding the loyalty discount) when I approached them to buy off my device. It would have been much cheaper if I would have purchased my phone from JB Hi-Fi or any other retailers for full price or even on a monthly plan. Never getting a phone from Vodafone again.,1
Overcharge - Be careful to join,"Having used a few different mobile / sim plan providers (virgin, optus). Vodafone has a manipulative policy and terms to charge customers.up paying 4 or 5 times the cost if you decide to leave within a billing cycle. This terms and condition is unique to Vodafone and actually violets Consumer Law as they are charging customers for services not provided.

Can't be bothered dealing with their customer service as they didn't even try to help waiving the fee given the fact that I've only used the service for 7 days. 

A reminder here for those who're considering joining Vodafone.",1
After sales assistance? Not received,"After two years, I decided to return to Vodafone as a telephone operator. I specify that with the previous provider (Kogan mobile) I had a great time, spending half. However, having purchased a smartwatch, Kogan does not offer the possibility of combining it with the phone to use it independently. So after some research, Vodafone was offering the best price between Optus and Telstra. As soon as the rechargeable plan was activated, the website and the app did not recognize my phone number. After three weeks of waiting and calling customer support every 48 hours (following their directions), the problem did not go away.
In the three weeks of requesting assistance, no one from Vodafone Australia contacted me trying to find a solution.
I, therefore, decided to activate Optus.",2
The most horrific service I have ever encountered. Also experienced dishonesty.,"Ordered a new phone on plan 21/12/20 - Was advised 2 day delivery. This was perfect for me as I was travelling a week later. 04/01/21. Still nothing received from Vodafone.
So I went on to chat line. The checked order and said it was pending. I said I know that but can you cancel this order as requested, as I no longer need the phone.
He told me I needed to call the sales team to do that.

Poor &amp; Frustrating Service,"We have four mobile numbers on our account and had to swap a sim on one of the mobile phones as a new handset had been purchased.  The holder of the handset went to their store and asked them to swap the sim.  They had the mobile with them, had ID and also the account PIN on the account and they refused to help.  I then went to a store and told them what we required and they would only offer a new sim and told me to do the transfer online.  This did not work.  Something is wrong with their site.Last night I travelled to the home of the person using the mobile and we attempted to swap the sim with no success.  I chatted online with 4 staff members (ridiculous) and we still were unable to get the new sim allocated to the number.  I was sent a few links and told that Google Chrome may be the issue and even after downloading Firefox the issue was still there.  I then called from my mobile that is also on the account, provided our PIN, my name and account number and then they sent a form asking for a photo of me with a government issued photo!  The call was disconnected while I was waiting on their staff member to investigate the issue and as it was then after 10pm I could not get any service.  
I took the mobile with me and tried calling them again from the handset this morning.  They sent off a technical report on the fact that the swap could not be done online and told me to go back to a store.  This service should have been done by the staff member I was speaking to.  Feeling totally frustrated and let down by their staff and ridiculous ID checks (they had 5 forms of ID already!) I sent an email to TeleChoice as we also have spare sims and an account with them and requested a transfer of the number to them.  I received confirmation of the transfer in 1 hour and seven minutes.  Now that's service!",1
"Ordered NBN, it has been a nightmare over 7 weeks and NBN still not working.",Nbn doesn't work. 4g backup is terrible. Agents have no idea. Complete waste of time. I am so over the poor service.,1
Vodafone comms misrepresent their product services,"I recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 LTE version for the purpose of training for a marathon, for which the LTE version is essential. Upon attempting to connect my phone with the Vodafone Numebrsync plan (to access LTE through the watch), I was informed after several conversations with Vodafone customer service that my non-Samsung phone is ineligible to access the plan.ir website. At no point is it stated, or I was given information that my current phone was ineligible to access Numbersync. The Technical support officer at Vodafone confirmed  that the Vodafone website does not contain any advice as to this requirement. Samsung clearly promote the fact that any phone can access LTE through this watch. 

Optus confirmed availability of their plan with Samsung watch from any phone type. 

Vodafone refused to release chat transcripts to raise the issue further.",1
thieves,"they STOLE $844,55 from my account without my permission,  and the worst part about it it was there mistake, they did offer me store credit or credit off my next phone bills , but won't refund money back to my account as they say they can't do that , I've spoke to these people once a week about this issue and each time they say  they would let the creditors know what's going on this went on for over a month,  and still STOLE my money",1
Beware of  Vodafone!,"Just make sure you don't ever need to ring their customer support team to assist you with resolving any issues, because they can be the most arrogant, dishonest and rude people that you ever have to deal with.  I can't wait for my contract to end and not sign with them again.",1
Gets what I need,"I am not sure about coverage, as is obvious not comparable to Telstra. But for my travel needs, Vodafone is the best, even better than Optus. I travel around the Pakenham/Cranbourne/Frankston/Glen Waverley lines and they are really reliable.free not fussed.

If an item is out of stock, but you had already ordered it and waiting shipping, just nego with them and they can do something better. Recently there was a MotoXStyle promotion, but out of stock, just nego and they are happy to provide an even better (personal preference) Nexus 6P.",5
Terrible! change other honest network,"Three times! In the last day of the billing day to add the extra $10 data into my account. Change other honest network. You may expense more, but actually you cost less.",1
Worst customer support,"Rubbish customer support guys, worst mentality ever, added $10 on my bill for no usage, when I spoke to them, omg, unbelievable response, no one would dare to talk to him, if he could credit that amount he wanted to charge me another $10 on my previous bill and now if I have to pay that it will be late payment an extra $15 should be paid. This is hilarious response from customer support. This will be my last contract ever and I will not recommend Vodafone to anyone.",1
Terrible! Will switch to another provider!,Vodafone has automatically added $10 extra charge for extra data that I have ever never required. The old website allowed us to turn off the add-on to stop this monthly extra data but the new one doesn't allow it. That's completely crap. A real robber.,1
Terrible service and customer support team,Being loyal customer from last nine years they haven't resolve my problem. Nowadays customer service is the main focus for any business. They loosing five no's in my family changing to other service and we will  keep tell all my friends about this issue and aware them of Vodafone.,1
Never ever buy vodafone,Not good customer service. Never fulfill any promise. Wrong billing as well. No resolution even after chat twice. Just false promise as same again.,1
Perfect service,I have been with Vodafone over 6 years and they have never let me down. Their provide excellent service over the phone.,5
I went to the store this evening 2/5/16 4.30 pm the staff wes not very helpful just everything one w,"Forget about network service, customer service comes first without explain anything the customers don't care about the network please try to get right sales person for better service",1
Not very good customer service,The customer service didn't honored the costumer very well. Need to be reviewed again the way they handle their customers.,1
"Auto-roaming? It's attempted ""Robbery"".","I have been with vodafone postpaid plans for years. Recently when overseas, they sent a text totell me i am on auto-roaming at $5 per day unless i ""opt out"" by ringing them. Well, it's their plot becauseit is next to impossible to ring them here never mind whilst overseas. I call this ""desperate marketing"" andam not impressed and thinking to switch REAL quick.",1
Terrible customer service,"Absolutely terrible customer service, they are pretty fine as a internet and phone provider, but if you every have to ring them you're in deep trouble, you'll be transfered about 20 times and wait for ages. When ever you ring them just answer the prompts as if you are looking to buy a new phone and you should get thru sooner. Go with Telstra",1
Internet service is rubbish!,"At first was a good deal because it was the cheapest plan (phone+plan) on the market. But now it's a nightmare! It was suppose to have 3-4gb of data but I can't use the google maps or listen to music on pandora! I'm not talking about watching videos, just listen to music and don't get lost while driving..Just waiting to this nightmare plan to end and I will never get vodafone again!",2
Great service,Been with Vodafone for 16 years.Live in metro Adelaide and always have service. No problems Billing is fine. Website is good. Very happy. Will stay with them.,5
Crap coverage !!!,"Why the hell Vodafone outsource to India !!!Liars and cheaters , I'll chasing them from two months for network down down and still the same !! Promise me it's going to be ok , and until they fix it they are going to give a discount of 45% for three monts , when I ask for acknowledgement through mail , they said don't worry it's all here on the system , bloody liars and cheaters!!!Don't ever go on their plans !!",1
Vodafone Make people Fool While doing Contact,Vodafone Australia is making people fool while doing contact. They say you can upgrade your phone after 2 years and when the time came for upgrade they say you can't do it because we have this policy and that and when want to cancel contact they want to pay cancellation charge this is nonsense. Never ever refer this company to anyone.,1
I could give no stars I would!,"Where do I start. You could be standing two metres from a tower and still somehow get sos. I was a loyal customer for 8 years (yes stupid of me to put up with their crap for so long) payed $100 a month for most of those 8 years for rubbish service and rubbish customer service. Finally I was fed up and called recently with 4 months of my contract left the woman who I spoke to was rude and abusive and told me if I wasn't happy to ""go to the TIO and good luck""; so I did. The next person I spoke to was down-to-earth and could clearly see my area was full of black spots and eventually agreed to release me from the contract free of charge as long as I payed the remained $144 for my iPhone 6. I was happy to do this and was told if I wanted to keep my number to call the provider I planned to go with transfer the number then to call voda again and they will finalise the closing. So I did exactly that within a day and called Vodafone and what do you know, the same cow who told me to go to the TIO was back on the phone and was clearly frustrated after reading the comments left by the previous customer service rep and hung up on my face. So I call again and am put through to another gentleman who said there was no visible comments or anything about terminating the contract and he would go speak to his supervisor. At this point I received an email from the TIO saying they had contacted voda and the next steps to take. After the customer service rep returned he was so apologetic and was happy to honour the termination and to pay the $144 as agreed for the handset which I assume the tio must of hit them pretty hard. 

In conclusion if you are in the same situation like I was and Vodafone are being the difficult they are go to the TIO and let them deal with the scammers. I've since changed to Telstra and am getting the same exact plan except I pay $30 less a month and have double the reception and speeds!! Go figure. I guess I've learnt my lesson. Avoid VODAFONE like the plague unless you live next to tower and want 1 bar!!!",1
coverage lets me down,"I am with tpg, sim card only plan. They changed from optus to Vodafone. Since then coverage has been terrible. I have been with tpg for approx 13 years and live in a regional area. Cost is good , customer service is good but all that isn't important if you cannot get coverage.",1
Expensive campare to other networks,I am Spending more than 70$ geting nothing just only 3 Gb data while other networks provides upto 10 GB in less than 70$. And i have left a few months i will not recommend vodafone to Anyone. Even they don't have referral bonus i personally referr two of my friends with vodafone.,1
Vodafone Cancel $104 Credit,I purchase $20 of prepaid credit every two months.  I had $104 of credit with Vodafone Australia.  They cancelled all $104 of my credit because I failed to recharge with in the two month period.  I no longer purchase any prepaid credit and have ditched my mobile phone.,1
Can't keep their words and a cheat,"Vodafone Australia I am usually not a person to do this. As matter of fact, this will be my first time to criticize a company on social media. I currently have a phone plan with you for my partner under my name. agreed on, yet the month after you charged me $65. I complained and you paid me back $55 after a week of back and forth. At this point I made it very clear AGAIN that I will only pay $10 for holding the number which you agreed to. 

Now, you charged me $16.59? Only $6.59 over but where did this come from? The first $65 you charged me i can understand that it is an honest mistake, but this is just an unethical business conduct. You may also like to know that I personally moved away from Vodafone after being charged my monthly payment 3 days in a row and taking almost a month to sort out which the day after it was supposedly sorted, you charged me what you refunded.

I am highly disappointed in your business conduct and I strongly encourage people to move away from Vodafone as I am not the only person that has experienced inconvenience regarding the charges from Vodafone.",1
Revolted,"I have been a customer of vodafone for nearlly 5 years now, ive been happy since ive started, only my last year for my plan has made me decide i will never go with vodafone again, calling customer service about an enquiry i was always placed on long cue's and having to spend hours on the phone to get no where really, ive had staff hang up on me even, after i was unhappy because my phone was faulty after the first month, i wanted to replace the phone and was happy to pay a small amount extra even, but was told i had to pay full price and was best to call vodafone directly, i wanted nothing but my last bill they raised my monthly plan by $50 the following week and still had a faulty phone, but speaking to customer service no one can understand why, but they could not change this either, i was sold a faulty product but would have to pay full price for a new new phone and i was charged extra either way, never seen such un proffesionalism in such a large corperation, i would never recomend vodafone to anyone!!!!!",1
Disgusted,"A Queensland based sales team contacted me ( I am a business customer  in NSW ) offered a new contract with outstanding benefits , concessions and devices , received my agreement, ""signed"" me on the 24 months contract , then for some reasons shelved the entire deal without letting me or central office of Vodafone know and it took me 20 humiliating calls and talks with different ""resolution teams "" trying to convince them that someone had indeed called me ( they were claiming all the  time that the was no record of any call) . before someone agreed to contact Queensland Gold coast office and unearth the whole botched business, but now Vodafone denying parts of the promised deal.",1
Excellent customer service!,Every time I've dealt with Vodafone I've had excellent customer service. Most telco companies are terrible but Vodafone has always been a pleasure to deal with. I called them and they answered within seconds. Took care of my issues and enquiries and gave me a discount because their service wasn't up to scratch. Well done Vodafone!,5
Appalled,"I have been with Vodafone since 2005. I have 2 postpaid plans/SIM cards with them. They cost me over $280 each month.I used to have 300 minutes worth of international calls to any country on each plan.I made enquiries to find out how my friend visiting Australia could use one of my plans for a few months. She uses calls more than data. I use data more than calls.I was advised it is possible to SHARE data and call allowances between the two plans so I wouldn't have to swap SIMs to access my data or make calls and that way I could always have my main number/SIM on me.
For that to happen I had to change the terms of one of the plans so that one of the SIMs would give me 140 minutes worth of ""international calls"" to 70 selected countries which I did on the understanding that I still had 300 minutes worth of international calls to any country on the other plan to share!
My friend has since made calls from the plan with 140 minutes worth of international calls to 70 selected countries and to my surprise was charged $84 excess because she made calls to countries that are not in Vodafone's selection. ($59 of that has since been waived.)
Meanwhile the 300 minutes worth of international calls to ANY country (which I believed she would use up first while ""sharing"") are unused and CANNOT be shared between the two plans. ONLY the Data can be shared, I have since learnt. I asked to revert to my original plan (that offered 300 minutes to any country rather than 140 international call minutes to a chosen few) and was appalled to learn that this was NOT possible. Seriously? In this day and age? To top it up there is nothing more Vodafone can do to help. It is going to be a long almost full year paying these off.",1
The customer carer by name Sumeet is strongly helpful,"Hi vodafone team, I used with vodaphone last 4 years and it was great experience amaging network but when I joined shared plan they said it's prepaid and after 4 years I found some other providers are reasonable then vodafone so I tried changed provider and when I called to stop my plan they said now this is postpaid not prepaid. What a disgust, they recommended me when I joined they said shared plan are prepaid but infact it was postpaid and long story to stop with vodafone but ultimately I have finished vodafone and paid them every single cent and started some else. After 5 days they sent me bill what a crap who sent me shamless bill for nothing. I was shocked and need to contact again but thankfully I have talked to right person Mr. Sumeet who helped to me got rid of that bill and guided properly and made my day as I was so upset since I got bill for nothing. Thank you thank you so much Sumeet you deserve to be there where you work. I reccomend people when you want solution for vodafone just talk to Sumeet you will get what really need from vodafone. Thanks Sumeet once again. Very happy!",4
Beware of vodafone!!!!,"Disgusting service!! I would give them negative if I could!!! I left Vodafone which was the best decision I ever made, upon leaving they said I didn't owe anything than weeks later send a bill demanding money threatening to put a mark against my name for a bill I don't owe. They shouldn't have the right to do that to someone.",1
A customer for 13 years and any issues always resolved properly.,"Vodafone have always been polite, professional and reasonable about any issues I've brought up with them over the 13 years I've been a customer. I know for a fact that myself and other people I know who are with Vodafone don't agree with the bagging of Vodafone. Not everyone in society has a full compliment upstairs and knowing what a good company it is, I honestly think the gross dissatisfaction expressed by some people is more about them than Vodafone. Vodafone is a company that has always served me and people I know well and I have no hesitation in recommending them.",5
Vodafone don't care about customers!,I wish I could go back to EE but I'm locked into expensive contracts with vodafone. They won't give me the data I'm paying for and won't listen to me when I complain. The last time I complained they sent my account login details to strangers. So now I'm too scared to complain again. I really wish I could leave now. Vodafone are stealing my money and I can't do anything about it until the end of my contracts.,1
No Appreciation,"After speaking with multiple customer service operatives and sales team representatives, the Vodafone team gave me this impression: if you're no a month to month basis, they will grab on to you and give you good deals; however, if you are on a plan, they don't care the slightest bit because they know you won't leave any time soon. 10 years and you're offering me nothing. What's stopping me from going somewhere else?"" Her response was simple, ""Nothing. Oh, but you're on a contract.""

Leaving Vodafone the moment my contract expires. Extremely unsatisfied with the rudeness and carelessness of the team. I definitely do not recommend it to anyone.",1
Disgusting.,"Vodafone sold me a brand new phone that broke, I send it away and get given back a second hand one that breaks so i send that away and then they give me another second hand one that breaks again then they offer me another second hand phone but a different handset for a small fee of $400.",1
Terrible system and arrogant telephone customer service,"Tried to help someone to change from a postpaid plan to a prepaid plan, it was a simple task almost made impossible for someone who doesn't speak good English. I will cut it short because it seems being passed around from department to department and long waiting time is just a default nowadays . When we finally got to speak with the right department, the customer service lady M over the phone insisted that the account holder had to call through an interpreting service to talk to her, because it is required by the LAW now,  no family members and friends can help to make a service call, and what's better? The interpreting fee needs to be paid by the customer! This is just ridiculous and unreasonable!  Imaging using an interpreter to wait with you for the RIGHT Vodafone customer service person, God knows how much the customer will end up paying for using the interpreter to make a simple service call! The lady I was helping was so frustrated and helpless because Vodafone store members couldn't help her, customer service people wouldn't talk to her if she doesn't use the interpreter. She is paying for a service she cannot even access without paying more to use it! It just upsets me thinking when Vodafone signs people up, perhaps there're no communication/language barriers or whatsoever , but when you are with them, this is what you may end up with. Do Not Use Vodafone...",2
Would you pay for an item that does not do what is expected?,"I was with Vodafone for my mobile services however the service was absolutely appalling, calls constantly dropped out, service was intermittent, you would have service one day in an area and the next day you would not. As a result of not being able to provide what was promised, I refused to pay the bill, and I always pay my bills to service providers who deliver, when I discussed my concerns with Vodafone the care factor was zero and they placed my name on the bad credit register (VEDA) and as a result I have been unable to apply for credit cards due to this SINGLE bad credit rating. When applying for my mortgage it also showed up however when I explained the details to my financial institutions they completely understood as they have had a lot of people who were treated the same way by VODAFONE. So my advice to you is do not go with VODAFONE under any circumstances. Or if you do NEVER refuse to pay your bill even if you cannot use the service promised by VODAFONE, otherwise you can look forward to seven years of bad credit rating which may affect paying for overseas vacations, medical procedures, etc. or anything that you may otherwise put on a credit card.",1
Internet so slow!,"So I use Vodafone data 4g supposedly on my iPhone And iPad. It is the worse! It says 4g, the area is 4g yet I can barely load the page most times. It is always slow. 1hr later I think I was able to view like 2 pages or something... No joke!",1
Good on you Vodafone,Have Mobile Red 80 plan with out problems.  Accounts have always been accurate. Always had helpful staff.  Been with the Company for around 8 years.,5
Horrific Customer Service,"While trying to resolve an issue with my plan I was placed on hold for over 4 hours. When I finally got through they hung up on me. After hours of arguing with sales support staff, they offered me $10 credit expecting that it would resolve my issue. The incompetencies of this organisation are truly outrageous.",1
Worst customer service ever experienced!,"I wanted to quit Vodafone so I had to call the customer service. Over last two months I made 4 phone calls, average waiting time to speak to a staff is 15 minutes. The staff are rude and helpless. They were wasting my time trying to convince me to stay with Vodafone, no matter how determined I am. They were playing with me either by keeping transferring phone calls or finding excuses like my identity cannot be verified, head office was closed. The last staff I spoke to even hang up my call without a tiny bit of courtesy.",1
Manager Hangs Up In Your Face,"Do not bother joining them!!! The managers even ruder than the staff, they hang up the phone in your face and they do not give you a chance to speak. I am paying more for a galaxy S6 on a worse plan than the plan they have released recently for the new handset the galaxy S7 and I'm telling them that I am willing to pay the same amount for my current handset, if they only increase my data from 3gbs to 6gbs which you get with the galaxy S7 for less than what I'm currently paying. Rubbish company can't wait for my contract to finish to finally leave them!!",3
Very poor customer service :(,"I switched from equally as rubbish Optus, I asked for a month to month plan and I wanted my old number transferred, The phone support person opened me a prepaid account with a new number, after speaking to a manager the account was transferred to a post paid service, he told me that the phone would be working within five minutes and I would have to ring back later to have my number transferred. TWO DAY AFTER and countless phone calls my phone is still not connected and and my number is still not ported. Indian callcentres don't care and lie to resolve the issue. I thought they would be better then this, but was I sadly mistaken.. Back to Telstra I go :(",1
Malfunctioning phones,DO NOT SIGN UP WITH THEM!!!! They give you malfunctioning phones that I doubt are brand new and resealed. Go to repair centre and they give you some one else's malfunctioning rubbish . I have 4 phones with them but not anymore. Bye Vodarubbish,1
Switched from Telstra,"Switched from Telstra â€“ cheaper plan for more mobile data (though it was a special offer), and same on SMS and calls. No noticeable differences in reception, and the Vodafone app is much better than Telstra's. Did have a slight issue with customer service however. I switched to a sim-only contract, which I bought online. I wanted to retain the same number (what they call ""porting"" the number across), but there was a slight hiccup, as the Telstra contract was in another person's name. Vodafone's website informed me that the port would be simple, and all I needed was the other person's permission for it to occur. However, when I actually called Vodafone to do this, I was informed that I needed to transfer the Telstra contract into my own name, which required oodles of paperwork and a credit check. (The Vodafone rep I spoke to on the phone wasn't very helpful and difficult to understand, though I was able to get through very quickly). So I gave up and just went with the new number. Vodafone need to update or clarify their website on this issue.",4
Good,"Been with them for years (before i was with ""Three""). no problems best company by far with the best plans and best 4g as long as you don't go beyond the limit.",4
Will never go back to Telstra.,"Made the switch about a week ago and I'm blown away at how good this is. I'm paying less, getting more and even the reception is better! The guy at the shop who set up my plan did make a mistake, but I called the 1555 line and in about 20 minutes it was fixed, they were so accommodating. 10/10 would recommend.",5
Terrible network,"I was with boost mobile before, and last year switched to Vodafone . Their network is a joke. Cant get any reception when I am working on ground floor in my office building. Now I got a Telstra prepaid that I carry as a second phone.",1
Mobile calls mysteriously drop out !,"For months I had experience mobile phone calls suddenly drop out. A ""beep"" sound is heard on the phone and so does my caller, since 2015, and then the call drops out. I phoned vodafone, months ago and I suspect vodafone had updated upgraded their infrastructure at the time. All was week for approx. 2 weeks, then the same thing happened again. 2 weeks ago in late Feb 2016, I called vodafone again..same problem again as mentioned above.. long and behold again..my calls started to drop out AGAIN!!! On the 26/2/16. Vodafone you are hopeless and now I am changing phone carriers!! Was with you for close to 20 year and this is how you treat customers on your network. And p.s it is not my phone!! its vodafone playing up!! If your retail store employees tell me to change carriers then WHAT'S that telling you VODAFONE?!

April 23rd 2016 Update: Calls starting to drop off again !!! Mysteriously again !!!

Hi all, Stuttgart here again writing a review. I was on the phone, 21/4/16 approx. 5:40pm odd and once again VODAFONE, up to your old tricks! My call mysteriously dropped off again! So you know VODAFONE, I was standing still at the time I was on the phone in an area with no coverage issues, in the CBD. So again I point the finger at your network. Guess it is time for your monthly mysterious customer call drop games.. keep up the great work VODAFONE!

June 6th, 2016 Update: Coverage is now mysteriously disconnecting 4/6/16

To VODAFONE AUS  - Do you not realise these negative reviews are hurting your brand name! Shouldn't your marketing managers release a statement to your customer admitting to poor services within and how you will promise to take immediate action. Start with returning jobs to Sydney and investing immediately in infrastructure and I.T system upgrades! Service your equipment monthly/quarterly/yearly, and if you don't know how to do this, hire an I.T/Telco consultant to audit your systems. Then stop disconnecting my coverage this weekend since 4/6/16. Remember its your customers that keep VODAFONE financially afloat and employees in a job! Those who don't like it and don't offer good customer service should be moved on, as it is clear many customers are angry with the VODAFONE network and customer service.",1
I will never be a vodafone customer again.,Customer service when there is an issue is the worst I have ever encountered.  It wasn't until I went to the TIO months after bad service that my complaint was resolved in a day.  Really poor form Vodafone - you have lost me and 4 of my family and friends. Very happy with my new service provider.,1
Avoid Vodafail,Never choose vadafail network when you use gps!! They got more bars means they got 2 bars. Thank god I switched to Telstra.,1
ACTIVATING SIM CARD,"Online application went smoothly. SIM card was delivered within a few days. But then the problems started. Trying to activate the card and port an existing number became a nightmare. Groundhog day comes to mind. I'd ring up and go through the inevitable hold, speak to a polite Indian who required multiple reference numbers and then passed me onto a recording. Then would come back an email requesting that I send 100pt ID.  After sending  requested documents no less than 4 times, plus 9 phone calls and it seems like days on hold I GAVE UP. DO YOURSELF A FAVOUR USE A DIFFERENT COMPANY!",1
After 18 years together .... a nasty separation.,Due to a decreased usage of my mobile phone I decided to go to prepaid with another carrier.  Called vodafone 3 days before my billing period ended to cancel my service.  I went to use my mobile that night as I still had $150 of unused call credit and they had cancelled my phone 3 days before my billing period had ended.  I had paid for the full month and all they could say is sorry they can do nothing.  GLAD to be out of that business relationship.,1
At the end of my tether - so frustrating,Despite years of promises to upgrade their network drop-outs remain routine and 4G is near non-existent. Sub-optimal is an understatement.,1
Terrible reception,Terrible reception and rude staff. They have no consideration for customers. They charged my credit card twice which I had to take them to Tribunal to get my own money back.,1
Had mobile with Vodafone for 10 years - always happy,Customer service is great.  The technical team can answer anything. Advice is always helpful.  Products great.  Happy with price deals,4
Vodafone 24 months sim only plan,I just got this plan and so far the network is great. Where I live I get 4g and most places I go its 4g all around. Speed is excellent and I 12gig data for only $45 a month unlimited call. 120 mins international calls to some countries. You just can't beat this offer at the present time. Sign up for 24 months sim only plan get heaps of data.,5
Crap Customer Service,"Really disappointing overall, if I had to do it over again I would stay on a budget no frills plan. Opposed to an expensive no frills pain from Vodafone.",1
absolutely no help or support,"have been with vodafone for over a year, and during that year have had multiple problems with billing and products. I have approached them on multiple times to resolve said issues and twice i have been handed a number to call to ask for help and shoved out the door, once i was told to google a number and call it for help before i was shoved out the door (how can i call when i don't have a working phone vodafone?), all the other times i have treated condescendingly and NONE of my issues have been resolved.in to discuss ending my plan, they told me it would be too expensive for me to do so and refused to continue our conversation. At this point money is not my issue, i just want my contract to end with this company ASAP.",1
Worst network,Called me to change to month to month plan but charged me 500 when i switched to other operator. Will never go back to vodafone,1
Started off well,I am on the $35 month to month plan and was easily able to switch between the month to month plans when i first signed up. Now I can only change to the Red plans which are completely different. I also have trouble logging in in the website every time i try. Going to switch providers.,3
Never ever get a service from vodafone,"Don't even dream of getting a vodafone. Worst network even within the 40 kms radius of Sydney. Annoying customer service, they piss you off. They agree they can't fix the problem but bring you all the charges over the cost of handset which will nearly cover all their cost of the contract term. I was using two phones for my business paying $10 on top of $60 plan. They charged me $399 only for the cancellation for 6 month remaining contract i.e only for the handset I was paying $10 extra. I loosed my business because of their crap network. I never recommend anyone to get vodafone especially those ones on business. Seeking forward to complain on fair trading.",1
Worst Network ! Full of Bad experiences !!,"guys they have the aggressive marketing strategies in the market , so shop around and  compare ! That is how i got hold of these guys, terrible network and least customer service ever had. I had an issue with the network and raised a compliant , they showed my mobile had fault in it . so change the mobile still had issues. Atlast went to the ombudsman to resolve the issue. very very bad dont even think of them.",1
Unfairly penalised for their own mistake.,Went to Vodafone rep at Narre Warren shop to change a credit card account for direct debit service but they still charge the old credit card which already been closed. They penalised us $15 for 3 months ongoing. Went 2nd time still happening. Not happy. Moved to a different service provider.,1
Never had a problem,I've been with Vodafone for over 5 years and have never had a problem. The plan I'm on suits my needs well (phone plus 1 gig of data and $250 worth of credit for $32 a month). The more recent addition of an extra gig of data when you go over your data limit for $10 is great and has saved me a lot on my bill. I'm fortunate enough to not have to have dealt with customer service much so I can't really comment on that side of things but the service and coverage is adequate for the price you pay.,4
Best customer service,"The Vodafone red team are amazing. They are always so helpful and go out of for their customers. There is no way I would switch to another phone company, as I know another company would not treat me with with such diligence and care.",5
Fast 4G speeds but too pricey compared with other mobile providers,I'm on a $40 postpaid plan for $70 every month. You get only 300mb data and $300 credit. Too little given for the amount I pay each month. Really disappointing,2
Pretty Good Now,"I've got to say, Vodafone have picked up their game in a big way.  A couple of drop outs here and there, but not often and on the data front, the speed it excellent.  I run speed test at home and it obliterates my ADSL2 connection from Foxtel Broadband (disconnected).  I generally get over 8mbps.  Service has been great for over a year now.",4
Really bad reception at my new address.,"I've been a customer with Vodafone for 5 years, and have loved their Service and product availability, until I have recently moved to Gorokan on the Central Coast NSW. The Service here both Wi Fi  and cell phone is an absolute disgrace. It is appalling. Please take note of this as it is a rapidly expanding area (Warnervale  2263.) with 100s of thousands people moving here and a new rail station to accommodate them. Please DO SOMETHING about this area Vodafone.",4
I would recomend to family and friends,"I would not give a telecom company a 5 star ratting, as we know that they do not provide the best customer service. But I think this is a industry-wide practice unfortunately.",4
Reception ....,Worst internet service I've ever had! Raging right now! I hate Vodafone! Cancelling phone and Internet modem with them tomorrow.,1
Reception ....,I commented above but I have to say it has gotten so much better. My only complaint is my iPhone (which I didn't purchase through Vodafone). On an awesome deal with plenty of Internet and unlimited calls. Have to say internet connectivity is no longer a problem,1
Customer service what a JOKE !!!!!!,"I made an enquire today about my daughters pre-paid acc, l explained to ""Sharon - Vodafone"" my daughter was going OS and asked her if there was suitable pre-paid deal which would suit allowing international calls, she  asked for my access number to the acc, l asked her why she needed the number, she said to view the acc details, l said what do you need that for, I only need advice as to which prepaid would plan would suit, she said she cant give advice without the access number, but l can walk into a store and get this sort of information, its not that hard Vodafone either train your staff or replace them, she was hopeless, poor customer service, and rude!",1
Bad service,Very bad services and rude customer service non friendly staff. my phone lost and the guys don't take my complaint. Please be aware from them selfish people and don't take their phone insurance.,1
I'm with Vodafone because of international calls only,"So bad. Right now, I'm in Dunsborough on my short vacation and just checked my speed : 0.07 download / 0.13 upload. Terrible and it's with full signal. I mean... What? And it's not just this town. I have many problems in Perth. Signal disconnects so often, terrible reception, 1 minute video buffers 14 times... The only reason I'm with them is because I can spend all my credits on international calls and that's the plan I got few years ago. You just don't get that any more. In few months, when my contract ends, I'm definitely switching to another provider. 2 stars because of the plan in using.",2
Poor reception with high price,"I am stuck in a 2-year contract with Vodafone because misleading information through a phone call and Vodafone refused to cancel the contract. My usual bill before the contract was $50, after the contract the bill goes up to $80 and sometimes $90. I am here just to warn the viewers that do not ever sign any contract with Vodafone, do not enter any plans, because I promise you will regret.",1
They won't refund me.,"I ordered a start kit and I signed to pick it up at the post office and then I returned it to their hands and said return to sender. I called three times now for a refund... The first guy I spoke with said my refund would not be a problem and I asked if he needed any information and he told me no. I still hadn't received it after a week so I called again and had to explain my situation to three people that call and all they did was transfer me. The third i called, I told the guy about my previous calls And he said helping out wouldn't be a problem and I asked if he would be the person i should talk to and he said yes... But then he transferred me and I had to explain my situation again to the other girl. I am so fed up with it. Just give me my refund.",1
TRICKS THEY DO TO CHARGE MORE. VODAFONE RED PLAN IS A JOKE!,First of all I was with VF for over 2years. So my first contract was fine. And they charged me a normal plan of $80 for 3GB allowance data use. Which was fine. As I was never going over 3GB. Then recently tried their new product RED PLAN. Oh my! My biggest mistake ever. It's a trap. They charge you a plan and not let you know that your 1gb data will be used within a day on your new iPhone 6. I thought that was strange cause within a couple of weeks I noticed I had to upgrade after having to add a few $10 add ons. I thought this was a joke. It was like there was a hole in my net line pipes. Like it was dripping from the pipes from holes cutout in the net web connection of my number. I thought this is not right for my data to be chewed so quickly. So I rang them and we did a check on my phone to see if there was a problem with it. Surprise surprise nothing wrong. Then they suggested it was because its a 4g. I was at the time tho switched on with 3G. Btw. There was problems in connection my area due to upgrades being done by Vodafone. As well as I was using wifi at my house with Optus. But the wifi signal wasn't as strong so I would switch between the 2. Vice versa.  It got to a point I was sick of explains my problem and them pretending to help when they didn't fix it. So I said within 3 months I needed to cancel the contract and for them to take back their phone as I could sign up to what turns out as approx $100 plan of theirs after realising their outlet to my phone was now being charged at double the rate. I have No proof but my opinion. I might add as well that the trick was the introduction 2month plan of unlimited data. After that than you have to use once a blue moon and monitor everything out of your life like in stone age the usage of your data with a fine tooth comb. So many times trying to sort this out I had VODA FONE staff on phone laugh at my problems and stress and just pass me around making myself have to constantly explain the situation. It was a horrible experience. But my husband finally spoke to them and they finally agreed to cancel my agreement. Only after he hustled them to listen. I'm now with Optus. And it's been ok so far. I'm on a $90 plan with 20gb allowance. As appearantly the usage gets more as the phone gets smarter. Which nobody explained at time of Contract with VODAFONE. However with Vodafone I was signed to 6gb for $70-$80 but by the time I was leaving I must have had about 3-4$10 add ons extra usage which was an extra 1gb every $10. And I was being told to go on a higher plan of about $100 for a add on data plan. Which only includes about 12-14gbs. It was messy and a joke. NEVER AGAIN! I'd say they've made my time of death a few years earlier with the stress they caused me.,1
Dead Data Connection,"Vodafone provide super slow data connection. It's so annoying. Not just outside Adelaide CBD but even in the heart of Adelaide (Rundle Mall), I often get trouble with data connection. With many complaining same, Vodafone engineers should be outside monitoring and measuring signal strength and, should fix this problem.",2
Wierd!,"I feel like giving ZERO stars but unfortunately that's not possible. From the day one, am using vodafone, it's always creating me some or the other troubles. Never ever have been happy with this connection.",1
Please dont waste your money with vodafone! Never ever use this anymore!,"Please don't waste your money with this service! The first few month was just ok. But later, They charge you some money that you haven't used yet! When you complain about it. they said similarly that is your fault it not their fault. all the charges are valid and correct. I have been charged for 4GB data in every 5 mins of the same day on the last minutes (11pm till 12) of monthly billing! When I said it is something wrong even they got triple check but they still said that they charged me for the right thing! I just feel it so ridiculous how come in 5 mins I  can reach full 1 GB data! Please trust me! don't waste your money! If you need move evidence contact me I will show every thing for you.",2
Cheap and Nasty,"OK, I've tried all the options for telecommunications in Australia. Let's face it, its a horror story.",3
Avoid At All Costs.,"I have Vodafone prepaid, during the week my phone is fine when I'm not needing it while at work. As soon as it's peak when I'm home or on weekends all of the sudden I have no service or pretty much dial up speed and I get an ""E"" on the top of my phone. I've actually had this ""E"" for a whole day now and thought it was a phone issue so I changed to a friends phone and its the same. They appear to block you or slow down your data usage during peak periods. If I use my mobile to stream I get blocked completely. Customer service at pathetic and have no real answers and to be honest they probably know we are being blocked but are not allowed to say.",1
Their Outsourced Call Center In India,Just got off the phone with their afterhours call center agent call. Looks like they have a quota to make sure that no customers were escalated to cancel/terminate service. They told me that they are going to transfer me to a supervisor but the so-called supervisor just hung on me!,3
Vodafone steals money if you don't pay attention to your bill,"I have closed my Vodafone account because I started using my company's phone. After that, I received a bill of $10. I was about to pay it when I thought that I should check the bill details.nstead just paid the amount, they would end up with my $10 in their pocket.

I asked the staff if they would have called me if I actually had paid that amount and he said they would not.

Imagine how many people Vodafone sends this bills to? I am pretty sure this is illegal as it is the same as stealing.

I will never go back to Vodafone and don't recommend it to anyone.",1
"Poor service, poor coverage","I'm from lakemba, sydney , 2195 nsw. im getting signal not more than 1 bar. i feel i will change my provider to telstra or optus.",1
The Worst Service,"Waste of time speaking to customer service, especially relationship managers never ever worried about the client and their problems. Vodafone fails to provide proper network and faulty supplies faulty mobiles.",1
Horrible Service,"I gave my phone in for warranty over a month ago, and still haven't received it back. After this contract, never going back to Vodafone. Employees don't know anything and very unreliable, worst experience of my life.",1
Vodafone Is Absolutely Horrific,"I have never written a review but have to on this occasion. Don't ever go with Vodafone. Says I have 4G yet the internet is so slow, photos never even load on Facebook. Paying $70 per month and am stupidly locked in to a two year contact, so so gutted.",1
Good service in the CBD but as soon as you leave the city,"Good service in the CBD but as soon as you leave the city it just goes bad. Sorry VF, I will be going back to Optus!",1
Disgusting Customer Service,"Absolutely disgusting customer service. I went on a 24-months plan which consists of $250 worth of calls and 1GB data. Seeing how I somehow always manage to go over, I chose a $10 add on option online. This ends up being a 'permanent' add on. I contacted contact centre and spoke to the manager and they said there's nothing they could do. Fast forward few months later, you can now remove that option.",1
5 years and I wouldn't change providers,Been with them 5 years no problems best company by far with the best plans and best 4g.,5
Awful customer service,"Reviewed by Risa Moody from UK on 20th Nov 2015After 30 years as a Vodafone customer I am horrified at the service I have received today - I have had dealings with at least 7 people in different departments - having to go through security every time and having to explain the issue each time - each representative having no prior knowledge. An awful couple of hours and live chat is worse!I have asked for my pac codes as it was really hopeless which will incur hefty early cancellation fees for two phones but what choice is there??Really disappointed.
 To add insult to injury I just checked back on my last live chat feed and [name removed] had actually written 'enjoy' with a smiley face after telling me I would need to pay Â£1,480,49 - disgusting!",1
Can't wait to leave vodaphone,I'm a loyal customer for many years and you ripped me off on downloads Internet $250 a gig! Now me and my wife and all my staff will leave you for Telstra!!,1
Do not sign up with Vodafone!! Try other network provider!!,"I have stupidly renewed my contract with Vodafone again...but I recommend everyone NOT to sign up with Vodafone.Vodafone will sweet talk you into signing but there is absolutely no responsibility on product/service they are providing. Its bad enough I have ended up with worst plan in network world (the plan they suggested because I am their loyal customer; whatever!)...but on top of that, i have issue with my iPhone that Vodafone provided me..okay, i know its iPhone but since I am paying Vodafone for monthly handset cost, if there is something wrong with the handset, I expect Vodafone to take responsibility to fix/replace the phone and deal with the issues, not fobbing off to your supplier!! Vodafone should fix my issue, and Vodafone can deal with Apple directly to get any compensation/claim or whatever with your supplier!...but instead, Vodafone staff told me to go into Apple store because i will have better chance getting a replacement phone if I go to Apple directly then going through vodafone channels..Vodafone staff were just plain rude and un-helpful..they just can't be bothered..why work there if you hate what your doing so much??why would you be in a customer service industry if you don't like speaking to customers?? I hugely regret re-signing with Vodafone..and I hope anyone who is thinking to sign up with Vodafone, think again and sign with another provider!!!",1
Zero Customer Respect - FRUSTRATING!!,"My husband got his Vodafone connection last year when he bought a new phone from their store. We were given a gift card as a complimentary worth $25.ft cards so couldn't activate it and neither did they have any notes on their system against my husband's name about the gift card. We were told by the customer service assistant that the issue had been communicated to their manager and she would action it. After another 30 minutes of wait, we got no responses from anybody and the customer service assistant had started looking at other new customers who came there after us. We were frustrated and tired and had to leave as we felt ignored. FRUSTRATING, in summary.Definitely wouldn't recommend their services to anyone.",1
Absolute Crap!,"Been with Vodafone for years...why? Good question!Thought they were going to improve but has actually got worse, is now similar to the old dial up internet.Absolute crap!Will be changing to the Optus network when I come back from overseas.Vodafone you are a joke and treat your customers with contempt!Nothingeverything.. poor connection, poor serivice",1
Vodafone Has No Integrity Whatsoever,"The 'cowboys' working at the Woden Plaza, Canberra Shopfront talked me into signing a contract for a faulty product and worse, a contract I did not need! They did not follow appropriate legal procedures, thus the contract should be invalid. There was no 'cooling off' period and the terms were not explained to me properly and worse the device they sold me was faulty. It dropped out which meant I lost loads of critical email data, which was profoundly frustrating, upsetting and time consuming.When I reported this fault to a foreign Customer Service person, I was told the 'fault' needed to be active at the time of reporting it! 
Well that would be difficult, if not impossible because the device dropped out inadvertently and it was normal to wait on the phone for up to 20 minutes and often longer for a Customer Service person to answer the phone! Who has that kind of time to spare?
I was obviously not happy so I made my way out to the Shopfront to report the problem again. In the end, I returned the faulty device to the Shopfront after the boys continued to treat me badly (to put it mildly). They offered me no assistance whatsoever in fact, made the problem worse. These 'boys', (I might add, were young enough to be my grandsons, which is significant, more so as one grows older), did absolutely nothing to help me resolve the problem. To say I was upset would be an understatement because I had approached the Shop more than once and phoned Vodafone more than once about the problem.
Vodofone had disconnected the service without warning and had piled on extra inappropriate charges I could not make sense of. It was truly upsetting.
In the end, after attempting to sort out it out online, over the phone (which took ages) and at the Shopfront, I handed the faulty mobile device to a young Shopfront worker and walked out of the shop, very upset.
Guess what? Vodafone are not content with their already bad Corporate misbehaviour, they are charging me for this faulty product I could not use and no longer own (one cannot use products attached to a server elsewhere) and for a service which was not set up appropriately and worse legally, in the first place. 
Vodafone is seriously out of integrity. Vodafone is advised to review its sales Shopfront procedures and to listen to customers instead of treating us as second class citizens. 
I am reporting them to the appropriate authorities (which is a lengthy, frustrating process) and fighting them to the bitter end! It is simply not good enough.",1
What a joke,"Hold times are disgusting, service is terrible. They have charged me a extra 10 bucks for data on a number that's not even mine.Pick up your act as your reviews are so bad, I wonder why.",1
Beware!!!!    never sign up with vodafone,customer service is terrible. there is no way to contact them. wait half an hour on a phone hold if you call 1555. no way to contact them via email. All i could do for them is to write this review. buggy app and no way to know exactly how much data/ credit have i used resulting in extra charges every month.,1
Absolute Money Scabbing Joke!!!,"Vodafone is a joke!!! The worst! So pathetic. Stay away, nothing but a money scabbing scourge.. Cheers vodajoke for ripping me off. Do not go with VODAFONE. I have been with them for almost 4 regretful and contract held years and O M G. I am not happy. Beware!!!",1
"Terrible Service, never do Direct Debit they put additional charges","Always make sure you check their bill. I just used service for 2 months and they charged me $10 extra for additional data even i have not used my 8GB of data at all in that month. Some of there agents are terrible, a lady called Kate on chat keep pushing to convince me that i have used 2GB extra data and usage was from my sim number.e in their infrastructure which is concerning. She was like doing favor to me and waiving off the charges without any proof of extra usage.

Talk to another lady on chat, and she was sensible enough to check the bill and apologies for incorrect charge put on account. 

Will not recommend anyone to go with vodafone ever. STAY AWAY......",1
They Are Experts,"They are experts ripping people off and charging hidden fees. Don't sign a contract with them, you will regret it.",1
Pleasurable experience at Elizabeth Vodafone shop,"I had the pleasure of visiting my local Elizabeth, South Australian Vodafone shop today. I say pleasurable as the service was impeccable. I was having problems accessing the internet on my mobile phone, a young man called Sam provided a superior customer service.

they dont inform your balance untill debt collector,my worst moment they dont inform you you're overdue notice and when you lost it forgot about it only thing person chasing is debt collector what is going never go on voda phone anyone on here get out of it when you can,1
Disgusting,I recharged my account and checked my bank balance as I always. Vodaphone charged me twice and refused to give my money back the service was not helpful and I spent most of my time listening to the hold music rather than the lady who didn't help one bit disgusted I knew there was a reason I wanted nothing to do with vodaphone.,1
Good speeds now,I was with Vodafone ages ago and experienced poor speeds. Now returning things have improved a lot! Have a great deal with unlimited voice calls and 6Gb of data for $60. Happy with performance.,4
DONE with this dreadful telco,"After almost 15 years with Vodafone, I am FINALLY kicking them to the curb. The last year has been the worst. Dreadful customer service, inflated ""surprise"" bills and hideous coverage. I've moved to Amaysim and am so relieved to be done with this telco. Scratch ya, Vodafail. No attempt to keep me on as a customer or to reward my 15 years of loyalty. Good riddance.",1
Vodaphone $40 plan,"I took out a $40 Plan with Vodafone on the condition that they wave the first month as I still had one month with Optus and got a comformation Email from vodafone to say it would be waved, but no information was  passed on to billing, spent aprox  2 hrs on the phone straitening this out, on the positive side I did get an apology",1
"Customer service is rubbish, phone service is rubbish","Phones service, and customer service is rubbish!!!! Had to take them to their TIO stay awayGo with Telstra and do yourself a favour",1
They Are So So So So Bad,"Vodafone do NOT help you AT ALL! The customer support does crap all and they don't offer any solutions whatsoever. I had a new htc phone for 11 months, it died and they do nothing to help all",1
"Rare connection issues, fair value","I took over a $50 per month account from a friend, though I probably don't personally even need this. For this I get $400 worth of calls, 1 gigabyte of data (with 500mb add on value for a total of 1.5 gb) and unlimited SMS. There are better plans out there now I am sure, but I have had this plan for nearly the entire 18 months.rier and trees) and even then, problems are minimal. 

I have always got what I wanted when calling customer service though thankfully those occasions have been rare. Their plans are a lot easier to understand than 'other' companies too - which reduces the need for customer service calls. 

The My Vodafone app makes it very easy to track your usage and also makes it easy to purchase add on items if required. I have purchased another gig of data for $10 every so often and have had never had any major issues with extra charges. You also get notification when you are getting close to your limit of call or data usage, so there really is no excuse if you go way over. 

They also email you when they are taking out your direct debit, a nice touch that I wish all companies copied. Its  easy to forget to have the money there when you have many outgoings, so this is a much appreciated fail safe.

Rip off and lack of information from customer service,"I was with Vodafone since the day one.customer service team called me in last December 2014 that they're having promotion if I am interested to add another phone to same service.i bought another iPhone 6 64gb.Customer service staff offer me to buy insurance over the phone.anyway my first iPhone was insured over the phone only.since I add another phone to my plan,2months later I lost my phone.i informed customer service and they blocked the phone but didn't offer any replacement.they were continue deducted money from my account.when i raised this issue with telecommunications ombudsman.Vodafone simply denied that my phone wasn't insured. If I could proof then, they could consider a replacement.everything was offered by their stupid staff over the phone.end up I am still paying the consequences even not using their service at all.Vodafone still chasing me to pay another $792.it's annoying but I don't know how to deal with the situation.even telecommunications ombudsman said I was right but there is no evidence.please advise.",1
Calling Vodafone,"It is not completely bad but neither good. I can say for personal experience that some people that works there is amazing, kind and really helpful. Today I call to cancel my Vodafone wifi pocket. The first lady didn't let me tell her that I haven't used my wifi for nearly a year, and start scoring me about ""why do I want to end the plan?"". I requested if was possible, to cancel the last month credit because I don't use the device at all and my contract finished. She said ""Its your fault for not having call before"".  I called again and a really nice lady this time talked with the supervisor and added credit to my account,  It could have happened the first time. So if you aren't lucky with them, keep on calling and you might have someone nice in the other side that help you go thought your request. Good luck.

I also have a cellphone with them, I won't keep my phone because it has really bad signal in Tassie. I hope this review helps you.",2
lies lies and lies,never inform you about the real situation keep on lying. horrible experience of a new purchase of iphone 6s. they told me you will get your phone on 2 oct and its 10 oct and no signs of any phone.,1
WORSE Customer Support,"First of all they don`t know what they are talking about..every department, every customer agent has different information and they mislead you so easily! The cancellation team says there is no network issue and cannot let you out of the contract. Where as the tech team says there is a huge coverage issue and it's going on for a very long time and will continue for another few months or may be a year.",1
horrible horrible horrible. They'll squeeze every cent out of you for services you don't use,"I signed up for Vodafone - cause it was recommended (worst advise ever)ro reception at my new place) , the only free day that I had to go down to Optus to port over on the 19th of March 2015 (chaddy was opened till 9pm on Thursdays). They continued to charge me for April even though have already port over, claiming that as the porting was only successful on the 20th (new billing cycle), so technically I was using the services and had to pay for the bill (and since it was direct debit, I can't stop them from taking my money). won't refund/credit me a pro-rated amount as they claim in their T&C, they are untitled to charge the full amount. . 

Not going to bother with them anymore - they can keep the $25 all they want - but believe me - they aren't going to last long with that kind of attitude. and here i was thinking that I should change back to them if i ever moved again or if their reception is going to improve at my new place. 

P.S. if it was possible, - i would give them a 'no star' rating",1
Rip off,I transferred a service to my name from my husbands name so that I could port it all done same day but was charged $59.99 since Vodafone charges a month in advance.  I expected that once they reconciled the bill the following month I would be credited since service was only with them one day and there was no on going contract. Month later no refund appears in my account so I call up and am told that this is no longer their policy they no longer refund or credit you and haven't been doing so for more than a year now.  This is bull they charge in advance but then no longer credit or refund you if you don't use that full month and think its acceptable to do so!  No one else does this I just cancelled Foxtel and they credited me for the period I had paid in advance but not used.  DONT EVER SIGN UP WITH VODAFONE I AM SO GLAD TO BE RID OF THEM!,1
No customer service,Just don't sign up with them because I have been charged for a phone service I do not even have,1
"Brilliant service, value and pricing but watch out for dodgy stores",Vodafone customer care over the phone is the best. The northpark store in SA is ridiculous I'm on a plan and tried telling me I had to pay out my whole contract to change my number due to it being stolen yet the customer care said it's only a one off payment of $19.95.,4
Excellent! 5 Star service and pricing,"My wife and I changed to Vodafone to take advantage of their $5 a day international roaming deal and we cannot say enough good things about both the product and the service. We're traveling overseas again in a few weeks and being able to simply use our phones, pretty much uncapped, for $5 per day is great benefit for both work, family and friends. Much better than $20+ for Optus or $$$ for Telstra. I also highly recommend the store in Melton Victoria. Well done Vodafone!",5
Vodafone is useless,"prepayed Mobile Broadband, SmSs dont work, coverage is as slow as dial up in some places, my vodafone is always down",1
Excellent local support,"I've just come off a contract and called Vodafone to move on to a monthly plan. I was served by local staff who were extremely helpful, courteous and were able to put me on a plan that actually bettered what other providers were offering. At the same time, I was on the phone with Optus today for another service and the stark contrast in service levels of offshore staff is obvious. Everything was read off a script. I won't be going back to Optus anytime soon. Good work with your support services Vodafone.",5
Customer Service,I called Vodafone just now to try to solve why i signed up for 2G data and been getting 1.5G and the customer service officer couldn't explain to me why is that and ask me to go to a store.Vodafone service is absolute crap.Can't wait to change network.,1
Vodafone saves at customer's exspence,"To all Vodafone users.  I'm an aged retiree who uses my mobile phone for contact with the RACV should my car break down.    I have a year long contract, which rolls over any unused credit when I recharge my phone.   The last twice that I recharged, Vodafone wiped my credits and just recharged my account and when I tried to phone Voda they messed me around so much, that I was continually cut off from my conversation with their service officer. a town but their country phone reception was unreliable.   For those contemplating dealing with Vodafone...be very carefull and study their fine print, because they appear to be trying to save money at this time.

Bad mobile network coverage,"What's the point of having a Vodafone Mobile Phone (Clyde North Area, VIC) with no proper network connection to the 3G Network. It has been more than a year and the service has not improve since.",1
Great value,"I really love the vodafone plans they are ideal for me. I can now use my mobile exclusively both in Australia and overseas to call home and abroad without any bill shock. The $5 roaming plan is really good, enabling me to keep my number and just use my phone as its meant to be used. Well done Voda.",5
The worst customer service ever,"When entering a contract with Vodafone, ensure that you understand and get everything in writing. I asked them to put me on a plan that I can exit anytime since I may go and work overseas for sometime and the sales man said yes. After 4 months I was assigned to go out of the country, so I cancelled my plan. 2 weeks later I receive a hefty bill. Very disappointing. They want me to pay for the remaining part of the contract.. I've called there customer service and I tried to explain but was told there is nothing I can do and that its my fault. I was rob by a multi million company. Vodafone will lie just to get you in a plan. Very low act. Companies that act this low shouldn't be allowed to operate in Australia.",1
Vodafone is pure crap,Called customer service and every time they redirect me to someone else and i have to start explaining my issue all over again. After all that still no resolution. I'm disappointed Vodafone,1
Worse service,"I am so disappoint :( I just start the mobile plan with Vodafone and not even 1 week but they add on $100 to my monthly bill, which is their internet service are very poor, sick, and slow. I have to turn off my mobile and turn it on again cos I can't open up anything on internet. and they add on $100? I'm sick of it",1
Vodafone account termination,"vodafone is a really low class company.  I ported my number out of vodafone as I join it for the global roaming service.   I joined vodafone on the 15th June online, activated my sim on the 23rd June.  It then starts charging my account on the 17th June $60 Red plan.  I terminated my account 19th Aug. Vodafone charges me $60 from 17th Aug (as that's my billing cycle date).  Its not the activation date its the billing date that charges go according to. No one can argue with their billing system, they said.  Very good excuse.  Behaving like that will not win customers VODAFONE.  If not for their bad customer services, Their plans are good.",1
Warning!!! The worst customer service ever!!,"I went on a contract with Vodafone I had poor reception that I put up with and then my phone broke due to software issues. I called for some resolution and all I got was ""go to a store"". When I went to a store, they told me to call. I explained I didn't have time to run around and all I expected was a good service (that's what I'm paying for) all I got was ""we understand"". I finally got out of my contract after a stressful ordeal. If I had someone warn me I never would've done business with them.",1
Happy customer,"I have been with Vodafone for a number of years now and the service has always been good, I would recommend pre paid as you can not overspend",5

Never buy that product,"Terrible customer service , never helpful , after of phone contract do not look after, very bad coverage,give a fear and you have to contract money until not finish , if you use service or not",1
VODAFONE you ask?  DO NOT DO IT.,"I phoned the 1555 from my mobile.  That's fun.  It's apparently the Customer Service line.  There is NO customer service.  I am not a racist but I am an Aussie and I cannot understand the Indian accent.  I tried, I was patient but the inflection in their accent is extremely hard to comprehend.  I asked them to repeat what they said and I had to ""read between the lines"" of what he was telling me.  They are not all rude but for the love of God I cannot understand.  I end most conversations with ""customer service"" without the answers I was seeking in the first place.  I am not on contract so I am not obligated to them.  My loyalty of 20 years has now come to an end.  I wonder which provider to go with now?  Does any provider have a customer service centre based in Australia?",1
Please do not buy from Vodafone,"Terrible Phone, nothing good about it, phone turn off itself. went to Vodafone store Morley in first week of purchase and they advised me that it is be cause of small processor and i should not download any apps and said it is standard issue of all smart phone and refuse to refund money.Another problem is in less than 2 months it has connection problem. connection is dropping out without any problem with network.",1

Pathetic considering I've been on multiple Telstra & Optus phone plans over $100 per month & never defaulted on them. Back to Telstra it is!,1
Worse service,"I would not even rate you 1 star because your service is really pathetic, trying to solve the issue since last 3 months but the customer services says your internet is working perfectly but it is not. Even at the vodafone center they need to learn how to speak to the customer instead of being rude. You guys are scam, I have already talked to several agents and told me that someone will come to my home and fix it now they are saying its nbn problem.",1
VODAFONE phone with hotspot use,I use a Vodafone hotspot with my PC for internet (50 Gig plus 3 Gig to enable sharing with spouses phone etc). Used to be very good but last few months service has varied a lot from clear calls etc to NZ using apps and phone to frequent dropouts mid call. I have had two sim cards changed to check it and today I spent about 45 minutes using online chat to try and find out about what speed Im on plus why the service varies. No luck. Passed from one staffer to another and no answers. In store also not good and got clearer info from an Optus staffer (female) on trying to use WIFI hotpspot effectively. Phone service seems slower than before with lots of buffering to download short videos via Whatsapp etc. Won' t consider Telstra as they do not include international calls which is a necessity for me. A nusiance if they are the most reliable service.,3

You pay for what you get... and you don't get much.,Worst network around including Sydney Metro (Sydney Olympic Park is dreadful). There is absolutely no consistency with Vodafone coverage.  It will go from being average to literally nothing while standing in the same spot. Phone calls and data are both extremely poor. I am using a 5G enabled phone that I was told by technical support to set to 3G in order to get a minimal data speed. Seriously! And a 5G network that has been coming for as long as I can remember and will most likely be no better.  I would really suggest avoiding Vodafone and paying a little bit extra for something you can actually use with at least some confidence.,1
Rubbish service,Block me from calling 1800 number without given notice. Then wait an hour to talk to someone. Never use vodafone!,1

Disinterested to help customers,"Went to Vodafone in Booragoon at 10AM today (16th December,2020) to ask regarding about trading in my previous phone. He was so disinterested in giving us any actual help and instead kept insisting that we could earn more if we sell the phone privately. I am aware of that but I would have still wanted to go through with the process but he seems annoyed I was there. I left extremely disappointed and does not even ask if I still want to go through with it. F*ck you to that person. You ruined my day and wasted my time.",1

"Big piles of pants, pants customer service and their on-line stuff... PANTS.","Vodafone, stop being total pants: get a 'contact us' system in place that works - an email would be good, this 'live chat' is terrible - talking to someone in India who doesn't know how to fix the on-line issue.... you have a FAQ section which isn't detailed nor cover a lot of real issues. Close the call centre in India, pay for some staff in the UK and spend the rest on a better on-line facilities for your customers. No point in spending a lot of money on your revamp stores with your after care service is PANTS.... 6 days & 4 calls to 191 since new contracts and still don't have on-line account or an answer to why the login details don't work.",1
No service coverage ever!,"I've been with Vodafone for well over 6 years and for every year they get worse. There is never any network coverage. My text,calls or even when browsing there is always never an issue. I rarely use my data coz I automatically connect to wifi when I'm home/work & the only time I use my data is check train timetables & internet banking. Since they've rolled out to auto $10 charge when people go over there data I've been getting charged. It's an absolute joke that they can do that,I didn't ask for extra data so why should I be charged?! Where was the option to not have that attached I my plan.How is that possible when I can never connect to the network. I can guarantee that once my contract is over I will be rolling over to Telstra.",1

It doesn't work with a screen protector or case, everyone constantly tells me they can never get me, the screen regularly won't recognise my touch etc.... I could go on.

breech of my privacy,"After someone possibly in a managerial position provided my partner with details of my text messages, l was askedvto fill out a for so an investigation can take place. Well vodafone did the investigation, and decided to close it without imforming me. When l called to find out where they were with the investigation l was told it was closed. When l rang and spoke to a manager, l was hunk up on after which l tried again and promised a call back to explain why it had been closed and l was not contacted. Well guess what..... they have not contacted me. I believe the person who breeched my privacy was the very same one who closed the investigation. My advise to all. DONT TRUST THIS COMPANY.",1
Misleading - Should have known better than to trust them.,Lost $50 on a short term contract trying to use their $5 a day overseas roaming option.,1
Terrible Customer Service,"I had been with Vodafone for over 6 years. They used to have their call centre in India however recently had it moved to Australia. Worst mistake ever. They seem to have travellers/people who aren't committed to the need working there--its awful. The last time I phoned i was so upset with the level of service that I told the lady on the line that I would like to cancel, she responded by saying ""that's fine by me."" That says it all right there. Needless to say, I have switched over to another provider.",1
I feel guilty to put on star cause I despise this company!!,Start everything with a discount of 5$ when I bought the SIM and after few weeks I get a bill with 5$ to pay...Payment online haven't works one and calling the service make u want shoot on your feet to feel less pain...Cherry on top I was going around happily with using the gps on my phone and a message pop up saying that they disconnect my service cause they dont have my update address... f______ b________ ....First shop I found of a different company I switch to them in 15 min keeping the same number...,1
Good service,"Vodafone have been myMobile phone service provider for  many years, I am very happy with them and have no desire to change service provider. Their customer service is great!",4
Be aware of vodafone's crappy service when renewing plan!,"I got  call from vodafone today informing that i have fully paid for my plan and requesting whether I would like to renew the contract with a new phone. I just forgot that I had two connections and the customer service didn't even reminded me about this and offered me an expensive plan and locked me in to the contract. After 10 minutes I realized that I had another connection and tried to asked from Vodafone whether its possible to  cancel or hold the order. They just kept me on hold for 25 mins and cut the line. I called them again and they kept me on hold for 15 mins and informed that no supervisors are available.

Then I received a text message from vodafone saying that they couldn't contact me. Its strange that only they cant call me back on my phone. Finally after 6 hours they said they have dispatched the order to the warehouse and they cant do anything regardless I have tried to call them several times. Also they said now I cant change the plan to a lower rate one and I can only upgrade it to a higher one. What they basically do is to grab as much as possible from a customer. Though I have been with Vodafone for 8+ years what they have offered me is same as the plan they have offered to a friend of mine who came to Australia only 4 months back! I will definitely change the provider next time. I'm sure no other provider has a crappy service as Vodafone.They trap you asking you to finalize the deal on same day. Just don't believe what they say...they just try to sell and trap you for two years.

Mobile phone service: I am generally happy with Vodafone,"Just talking mobile phone service hereI was with THREE about 7 years ago. How time flies. Then THREE was taken over by Vodafone.Everything was smoothly transferred, that was good.I was unhappy with them when Iphone 5 was first released because I could not get one before a certain day as the phone was so popular.Today I called and tried to find out if there is any better deal available before I leave them. 
The man on the other end said he could help me to find a better deal. 
Now, I got, 3G data, unlimited calls national wide, $300 mins international calls and it was for $50, now I get it for $35. No contract. I have also get this done for my wife. 

I feel happy.",4
Be mindful with service,I m with vodafone for 7 years and when i renewed my contract they put me on $ 30 cap (post paid) plan and told me that i will be charged for vodafone to vodafone. The plan i had if before was $29 cap and vodafone calls were free but not now. This is a reward for their old customers. My mistake is i already aggred to that plan in hurry but now i have decided to shift to another provider after this contract and never recommend to anyone to go with vodafone. Well my 4 friends already droped the vidafone soon my rest of the friends will go away too. Ridiculous and shame on Vodafone that their old customers are not happy who stayed so long with them.,1
Swapping a phone,"Hi VodafoneI am Vodafone customer from many years. Two days ago, my phone stopped charging. I was told that charging port is faulty & I was unable to use my phone.

Extremely Poor service,"Hi Guys,I have recently applied online for a Prepaid $50 Cap Starter Pack (At discounted rate of AUD25) from Vodafone on 07 May 2015. I was assured on email that the order with a sim card will be delivered in 2 to 3 working days. Till the time of writing this piece (Almost 5 days) I have not received any communication from vodafone. Though I am struggling to put across my valid point to Customer service who is not cooperating and and sounding too arrogant. I have been advised the following in online chat (Copying and pasting text) ""There are many reason why there can be delays with deliveries and we get that this is convenient for our customers"". Can anyone explain me how a delay can be convenient for a customer?? Now they refuse to even cancel my order and refund money also.
This is disgusting and deficient service. Hope Vodafone guys listen to this and improve their service levels.",1
Why the low rating?,"I have been with Vodafone for more than 5 years. I have to admit that Telstra and Optus are getting more competitive lately, but still, I think it doesn't justify the sheer numbers of of bad reviews written here about Vodafone.e plans offered by Vodafone at quite a competitive rate, which really, I have nothing to complain about.

In-store customer service has been consistently good. I have spoken to a few of their sales person since looking for a new mobile phone starting January this year, and they have all been fantastic (young, energetic geeks to be more precise). I don't go to franchise stores found in major shopping centres, rather, I unleashed all my queries and signed my contracts only in main Vodafone shops. In my opinion, I think one would easily get the best deals and services out of such venues.",5
about average,I bought a prepaid pre paid Vodafone Nokia 6220 phone from Woolworths fairy meadow/ the actual Nokia phone was great though I found that the using the internet was a time consuming effort and that sometimes making phone calls was hard so I decided to switch to telstra and never looked back,3
They kept billing me for a year and a half after I cancelled my service.,"Pros: Very slightly cheaper than other companies.
By far the worst phone company I have ever been with. So many issues.",1
Terrible service and coverage,"I bought a note edge through a vodafone store. The seller did not inform me of what Vodafone offers different contracts bought online vs a shop. When I found out two days later helpdesk didn't care. The shop said they didn't know what was sold online.... They offered me a bluetooth adapter and a case. I told them I just wanted a proper Samsung case. They told me it wasn't available yet. I returned a month later and asked for it. Now they said they didn't sell them. So I got nothing for giving up being an Optus customer and move to Vodafone - lesson learned not to believe what they tell you and promise you in their stores. 

The coverage where I live and even right in the middle of the CBD of Sydney is terrible. I was told by their support to wait 1-2 weeks as they were improving it, but no difference. They offered me $10 rebate for three months... as if that helps a very poor connection.

Update three months on: No change in reception in the CBD or where I live. Nobody from Vodafone has contacted me despite I named the specific store that gave me a poor service. Clearly Vodafone got me signed up and they are happy that I have to pay them for the period of my contract. That I will quit and never return afterwards is something they don't care about.",1
"Suspicious billing, disappointing customer service, slow 3G, among others","If you rely on mobile data a lot, don't choose Vodafone. The 3G is very slow. Moreover, if you have a dispute and need to contact them to resolve the issue, their customer service is extremely poor. When I switched to another provider, they provided me with the wrong account number, which delayed the documentation process. For this reason, I could not end Vodafone's service by the end of the billing cycle and was one day in the next billing cycle. They insisted on charging me the full monthly charge, despite me bringing up the account number incident. The issue was not resolved until I lodged a complaint with the Telecommunications Ombudsman. However, after agreeing to calculate my final bill on a pro rata basis, they issued me with a dodgy bill that was 30$ overcharged. I found out they included a mobile broadband charge for another number, which I never used. I am now lodging another complaint with the Ombudsman to resolve the new issue. The entire business was just annoying, time consuming and disappointing. Definitely won't recommend Vodafone for any one!",1
Pay As you Go Service is a Trap,"I and my entire family has been on Vodafone for a long time, there was never a time we had seamless service always had some or the other issues.Now we are on pay as you go plan - please make sure you top up your balance at the end of 30 days expiry after that you will lose all our credit, there is no grace days what so ever.I really feel the company is solely profit motivated.We have now decided to go with Telstra",1
Pay As you Go Service is a Trap,"The end is near for auto recharge, From 30 June 2015, Vodafone is switching off auto recharge service. This means more traps for people to lose their carry forward credits.",1
Over promise and under deliver!,"CS dont seem to know whats happening. Billing errors. Subscription errors. Every experience seems to be geting worse, the problems are closed and resolved when nothing is fixed. Called 12 times and the info was different every single time. how are these guys even operating?? Its a disaster and shocking !!",1
Disaster! stay clear,"had been with vodafone for 4 years and now decided to shift to another provided. renewed a contract 24 months ago, was told tat I can get 2 months free for renewing customer but then they only gave 1 month free instead of 2 months which i was told earlier. 2 years with Vodafone and I had enough of it, vodafone told me to call back to cancel contract before 25 april so that i can get my a-month advanced payment back and I did that on the 23rd April. Received bill today and made me paid for another month of payment and yet not giving back my money. Ridiculous!",1
Vodafone money grab to boost profits,I  accidentally paid my husbands Vodafone bill  and my bill 5 days late and for that they grabbed $10.00 for each bill. They advise you on the bill that they will do this and I could understand it if we were 14 days late but less than a week on bills totalling $261.98 It is totally disgusting. treating customers this way.We have a small business and we have customers owe us far more money for longer and we don't treat them this way. Vodafone I am leaving you ASAP purely because of your money grab and you will never get late fees from me anymore.,1
Just Avoid,Good luck if you are with these theives.  Customer service is terrible.  If they cant help they transfer you and put you on hold for min 20mins each time.  Phone always drops out because of bad network infrastructure so 60% of time your phone will have no reception and you are unreachable.,1
Overpromise Under Deliver,Signed up to an upgrade plan 2 months before my existing plan expired.,1
VODAFAIL,"This Vodafone is sucks.Customer Care doesnt care really.They don't pay much attention to the existing customers.All they care is how much do you want to upgrade and all that meaning they only care about money..Customer service is epic fail,there department in handling a complaint was sooo rude..I cant wait to end my contract soon...so disappointed today how they handle my plan...They dont listen to what you want they only do what they want to your plan...",1
VODAFONE - Talks the talk but doesn't walk the walk!,"After years as a Vodafone customer I'm just about to dump them...here's the story, I'm on the $45 per month infinite plan.This plan provides only 1.5 GB of data. it does not provide 300 minutes of standard overseas calls.The current red $50 plan advertised on the Vodafone webpage provides 300 minutes of standard overseas calls and 3 GB of data additionally as a special offer available until the 9th of April there is a further discount of $5 and an additional 1 GB of data making the final offer available at $45 per month with 300 minutes of standard overseas calls and 4 GB of data.

I called Vodafone and asked to switch to the new advertised $50 red plan which provides much mote than my current plan. I spoke  to a young lady by the name of Sara at the call center in Hobart. Sara was well spoken and tried to help however she advised the the offer on the Vodafone web page is available to new customers only and not available for existing customers. This seemed unreasonable and unfair from a company which has faced lots of customer criticism and displeasure in the past. Interestingly in the Age today 31 March there is an article in which Vodafone states  ""Vodafone Australia vows to reverse 'Vodafail' by the end of 2015"" It is obvious that Vodafone has no clue about retention marketing and keeping existing customers happy but rather is simply focused on acquisition marketing sucking in more new customers by new offers which are NOT available to existing customers. Once they attract new customers it seems Vodafone relegates them to a category different to one reserved for potential customers. Anyway Sara advised that she needs to obtain authorization from a supervisor before she can extend the same offer available on the Vodafone webpage to me.  After a long wait Sara advised me that Phoebe the supervisor will NOT honor the $50 red package and confirmed that the offer is available only to new customers.  I then asked Sara to speak to Phoebe again and point out that her position is not logical or good business, this she did and again confirmed NO can do.  I then asked if I can cancel my existing plan and resign on the $50 red plan, after some hesitation Sara said that there are two departments involved in this process and that I would lose my existing number if I attempted this!  at this stage I was defeated and gave up.  I'm now looking at plans with other providers and so is my partner who is in the same situation with Vodafone.

Once again EPIC FAIL by Vodafone.",1
Vodafail Returns!,"With voice mail drop outs, contact disappearances and phone staff that still don't speak enough English to understand the problem, I think that Vodafail is alive and back to frustrate anyone still using it. Wish they spent the Ad money on hiring more English speaking technicians!",1
Terrible From Start to Finish,The worst network in Australia. They are almost criminal in the way they conduct business! Very nice to you in store but offer 0 service over the phone! I wonder how long they will last.,1
Vodafone has been great... I don't understand the bad reviews?,"I moved over to Australia from the UK 18 months ago. In the UK, Vodafone is a fantastic service provider, so naturally, when I saw it was available in Australia I was immediately attracted!Vodafone Australia also appeared much cheaper than optus and telstra. Work colleagues told me not to go with Vodafone because they were rubbish, so I ended up grabbing a Virgin prepaid.... Now THAT was rubbish! Call drop outs and slow data speeds... and expensive calls overseas.So... I decided to ignore everyone and give Vodafone a go. I signed up for a sim only service about 6 months ago. It's $50/month and I get unlimited calls in australia, unlimited text even back to the UK and 3GB internet... plus 300mins overseas calls!!! AND its been great. I haven't experienced the poor reception I was warned about. 
This leads me to the question: Why does everyone have such a problem with Vodafone? 
For me they are fantastic.
I live on the Sunshine Coast in QLD.",5
I'm loving my Vodafone!,"Well this is my experience within the last 3 years.I was with Telstra for a number of years and got sick to death of being ripped off and experiencing what I deemed to be very average 3G and later 4G data speeds on my iphone.  My contract was up so I went to Optus as it was slightly cheaper.  I had to cancel my Optus contract straight away as there was ZERO coverage at my home address in Hope Island on the Gold Coast.  Unfortunately I lived in a pocket with no coverage.  Not sure why they even sold it to me in the first place.  I reluctantly went back to Telstra Prepaid for a while as I was sick to death of the whole thing.  We then moved to Brisbane and I decided to give Vodafone a go. I'd heard from friends etc their network was rubbish, but I signed up knowing they would cancel my contract within 30 days if there was a problem with their coverage.  

I've now been with Vodafone for over 10 months and I'm loving it!  My partner's iphone is on Telstra 4G and the data speeds received are just pathetic, in fact my Vodafone 4G phone leaves Telstra for dead.  Additionally my Vodafone leaves my iinet (Telstra) home broadband for dead.  I travel all throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast and I would be deemed to be a medium phone user and a medium/heavy data user.  I've always been able to get online when out and about throughout Brisbane and the Gold Coast and can only recall a couple of call drop outs in over 10 months.  I understand that if I head out of Brisbane into country areas I will likely not have much in the way of coverage, but I don't go to these areas, so I'm not concerned about that.

I don't understand all the negative reviews on here.  For me Vodafone has been cheaper, it's significantly faster than anything I've ever owned previously, and the customer service for my plan is (I think) based in Australia.  We head overseas to the US and NZ and I really like the $5 a day to use my phone overseas, as if you were using it at home.",5
Worst internet on the Planet...,"When signing up to these folks you'll soon realise that it was best to use a couple of paper cups and a very long piece of string.... because your gonna get a hell of a lot better service from it than turning your phone into an overly expensive ""micowave"" that really cooks your meat rather than delivering the internet....",1
the worst ever provider you can sign up with,"Hi everyone, let me tell you about my experience with Vodafone, I cancelled my account with Vodafone over 3 yrs ago due to there total incompetence, two days ago I received 4 calls from a number identifying themselves as Vodafone, also a friend that was used as a contact was also called looking for my contact details... I phoned Vodafone, 8 calls later I finally got a person smart enough that could ID me from my licence, you see I couldn't remember a pin from 5yrs ago (when I signed up)...  I have been told that vodafone did not make the call... ok if that is the case how did the person trying to contact me also have the details of person I used as a contact when I signed up years ago. I believe that if Vodafone didn't make the call than they have given or sold my personal details... of course Vodafone denies, the final kick to the guts here is that Vodafone is now telling me that because I am not a customer with them they Will not generate a escalation number for me so that I can contact the ombudsmen and take this further...  Think twice about signing up with this mob please.",1
Good Service,I have been with Vodafone for just over 18 Months and I am happy with their coverage.  I am using their AU$ 100 red mobile phone plan and 25GB mobile broadband plan. I get unlimited Oz calls and 300 mins overseas calls ( the only downside is quality of the international calls).I am very happy with Vodafone broadband speeds and also haven't had any issues when liaising with Vodafone red care team.,4
the customer is easy money?,"Hi,I had 2 mobile. One is mine and another for my wife. When My wife go to oversea. I explained I had had a suspension service before, and need one more if possibleI knew the policy is that only onetime can apply in the contract.When I explain the situation,they said no problem!! Sir. It sounds easy to help me out.1 month later, they charge me a full fee.And I asked them why. They said the policy declined it.  No one noticed me it had declined.p a promise. 
The Complain service also doesn't help anything about that company default. Just saying sorry and understand this And ask me that is ever thing solve out today?  XXit...
I want to keep an promise which you said.",1
Just plain fraud,"I am on a minimal plan with Vodafone! I am a retired person, do not make many calls (no more than 10 a month) because our home phone is a VoIP service, which is totally free.....no line rental and no call charges, so we tend to use that rather than the mobile. I deliberately disable the data, and only connect it to send a picture sms so there is no internet use on this phone!Every couple of months I receive a text from Vodafail telling me I have used up my monthly credit allowance well before the end of that months billing cycle, and invariably receive a bill for an amount half as much again as my plan amount. It's not a major amount, (only $10.00 or so) but it's annoying. 
Months ago I started to keep a track of my outgoing phone activity once Vodafail said I had reached my allowance. To my surprise I discovered I was being billed for calls I had not made to numbers that I do have phone contact with! How could this be???

A few months later the same thing happened again......On 30th Nov 2014 at 10.40am I received an SMS from Vodafone telling me I had reached my monthly allowance, and my plan would not reset until 5/12/14! So at that point I stopped using the phone for any out going calls or sms. When the bill came for that month, there again was this activity I was being billed for, but not making. At this point I took the phone to a competent technician who examined the phone and verified that the phone log, as stored by the phone was correct and had not been tampered with! 
Armed with this information I have waited for the same thing to happen again, and sure enough, this month the same thing. Vodafone notified me on the 27th Feb that I had used my plan limit and (as always) suggested I should increase my plan to avoid higher usage charges. From that point until today (5/03/15 when my plan resets) I have not used the phone for any outgoing calls and only one outgoing sms. Once again I will have the technician check the phone's data log. When the bill comes, if they are true to form and charge for additional calls over that past 6 days I am going to immediately hand everything over to a solicitor to take action against Vodafone....This is Fraud...nothing less. This is systemically charging people for service not provided and that is fraud, it's as simple as that. I urge all users of Vodafones service to check their itemised bills...I am sure I am not the only person this is happening to. This could well be the impetus for a class action!",1
Do not sign up or you will be SORRY!,"I also just received a bill saying that I have overused data usage, although I have been very careful and keen to monitor my usage. After spending long time to eventually get hold of their customer service (the worst of all phone provider in Australia), I explained to her about my good history of using within my data usage and requested for her help to see whether she could check whether this was a mistake from the usage data collection or could do anything to this so-called ""excessive usage"", which was very difficult for us, a customer to prove.  Disappointedly, she was keen to insist that they were RIGHT in generating the invoice and offer me 2 OPTIONS: 1 to pay the bill accordingly or 2. to ""Change the current plan to a more expensive one"".  I was so upset to hear this and dispute that this was a cheating and misleading of alluring Vodafone customer to ""upgrade"" the plans.  She denied using the word ""Upgrade"" but keep saying that she wanted me to ""Change"" my current plan to a more expensive one. Extremely UPSET and DISGUSTING !  What a cheating altitude and misleading commercial approach!  She did not even care a bit when I told her I would quit using Vodafone for good.  What a worst ever customer service! I really feel sorry for her boss.  Promised - Will never use Vodafone again !  Be careful and take this advise for every Vodafone new users!  I suggest every complaint users herein should lodge our complaint to Telecommunication Ombudsman to highlight this bad provider in Australia.",1
vodafone stinks in wyndham vale 3024,"hi, just wanted to voice my complaint regarding vodafone. went to my local allphones store at werribee i asked the storeman how the reception was in wyndham vale, he responded with the reception in wyndham vale is perfect and stated he personally knew people in my area that use vodafone and said thay said the reception is great. after the advive i recived of the storeman i perchist a samsung s4 on a 24 month plan around november 2014 thinking i was on a winner. BUT FAR FROM winning after getting home, maybe two reception bars on a good day if i sat it on the window seal then when i got an incoming call comes in the reception drops to zero and the phone makes stupid noises in which the other person on the other line hears to. just thay cant hear me. not just that the samsung i was given it self a couple of months after getting it never been droped or wet, then they replaced it for me with a referbished phone that has now died one day after getting it. and thay say i have bucklies of canciling my contract. if u have this problem aswell go on to google and type in (tio) to make a complaint as that is what i will be doing thay are your best bet to make the complaint to.",1

No good.,Looking at my bill and noticed they didn't credit me $10 like they were suppose to...not going on about the sum but the shonkiness of this company.  Been with them for 4years and I'm leaving them for good very soon. Fed up!,1
Soooo disappointed,"I received a text from Vodafone stating that I'd breached there fair use policy in regard to unlimited data weekends and would have my service suspended as a consequence.   After 3 hours of talking and being transferred between departments I reached the manger of the serious complaints department to have him tell me they would not b assisting me,  yet not one person could tell me how I breached there policy.I'm now changing providers and will never deal with them again",1
Should be CLOSED down! Beware of the con artist management!,"DATA Allowance Issue!!ng my matter and awaiting for an answer.

Be aware of the con artist management and they have failed to resolve this issue! Customer service staff are okay but they have NOT been able to help. 

Do NOT sign up and spit on Vodafone when you see their ad anywhere. I only wish this company become bankrupt and closed from this country forever!!!!",1
worst phone company i have ever been!!,Got this $40 monthly plan with 2.5gb data and after 4 months my bill was raised by nearly $60!!!!Called the company several times.....and they said they could not understand why I got that plan and cannot honour what was promissed.This company is so unprofessional.... SCAM. Do not recommend!!!@Open your eyes people.,1
Customer Service is worst!!!!!!!!,I was asking them for the excess data that was been charged in my account which i am not using it and have to pay it more than $40 for just 300 MB they said and the customer service i was talking to was arguing with me and just put on hold  for a ages this is really not good even their coverage is not good at some point. I will never continue my plan with them so please if you are reading this do not attempt in getting a plan with them... What a waste of money!!!!!!!!,1
100% Crap,Its ok but the over the phone sevice is crap word of advice get staff that speak english  other than that its not bad but if you ever have a problem with your phone lets just say i hope you know how to speak  a foriegn language !!!,1
Terrible customer service - complete ripoff,"I have been ripoff by vodafone for excess usage. every month i end up paying extra $50 to vodaphone for either excess data, phone or add-on services.. i have to spend lot of time with them over the phone explaning the issue and goes on and on.. i am stuck with 24 months contract.",1
A company with no morals,The most robotic customer service staff I have ever dealt with. Team that up with a complete rip off of a service and you get Vodafone. Sadly after 4 years with the company and a hope that they will improve through me being a loyal customer that has always paid in full and on time I have never made a better decicion than leving.,1
Been with them for over 4 year,They blocked my service after not paying 2 bills after I have payed on time for the last 4  years would except better service also my dad is with him prepaid and has an old handset and sends him free stuff for Internet usage but he has no internet they should know this so lame of them,1
Terrible service,"They offer the worst service in Australia. Customer service is a joke for them. Waste of your Money..Please don't do business with Vodafone , you gonna regret it as I did.they have the rudest people in the call centre and they don't listen to you . Damn I will never suggest anyone to take their service .",1
Terrible Service and Relations,"I was with Vodaphone and I have finally managed to get away from this company.After countless service drop outs and refusal of help by their ""technical support staff"" my contract has finished.",1
Don't waste your time,Vodafone would have to be the worst phone company I have ever had and I have tried them all. Your lucky if you get a operator that speaks English and then they don't care if they have made a mistake I was told to find another phone company if I didn't like it. After 10 year's goodbye Vodafone,1
Last time ever I use vodafone,No benefits for old customers . New customers get the better deals and top of that the reception is terrible in many places,1
they compare to much to their competitors,They are the worst ever they think they own the place and have the best customer service and 4G network the fastest in Australia lies their network is slow the 4g is crap and they make up so much lies saying they have the fastest only tho telstra has the fastest 4g network second optus has good customer service been with them since early 2013 had not one probelm optus is better than vodafail,1
Stealing your money!,"Back when the Samsung Galaxy Note Edge came out, I ordered one online. they were getting it so I went back to them. 

I did the same by ordering on with optus and refused to sign for courier and I didn't get charged for it. 

Vodafone should be only a last resort. Better yet, might as well not own a phone.",1
Don't even consider,"Never use vodafone. Especially for its data package. When we excess the data, even though it's just very few bytes, they'd charge for another unreasonable extra. It happened twice, first time, I was charged $400 for probably 400mb because the notification was late and I didn't know that I have to always check the online version so I complained about it, they said they'd give me discount but it never happens. I decided to went for another plan of $10 1GB and the second incident happened, I was charged $50. I don't know why but I always keep my eyes on my data usage and well, I thought it's okay because there was 100mb left and the next day I purchased another gigs but somehow their system didn't recognise it on time or whatever and they said they can't do anything about it.",1
'Vodaphone' is a disgusting service.,My dad and mum were struggling to pay a bill we  had to call them every day but nothing happened.when we went to the post office we phoned them every day and they said it will take 24 hours.,1
Vodapone user and happy,I have been using vodafone for 3.5yrs and have been really happy. Very cheap for unlimited calls.Vodafone has a map which shows where there reception is bad. If you live near or in that area then go with another provider.I have never had to use customer service so can't comment,4
"Appalling Service, absolute bunch of circus clowns","In my experience Vodafone are a complete joke when it comes to customer service. That automated customer service is completely useless and when you make a few errors, instead of transferring you to a real life customer service officer, it says is can't understand you and hangs up. They are stingy, their service availability is average and they just do not understand the importance of consumer loyalty or consumer word of mouth. Every chance I get, I make sure to tell anyone and everyone how poorly run the organisation is. I am a lazy person, so writing this and changing my service provider really shows how frustrated and disillusioned I am by them. F!@# Vodafone.",1
Expected feedback on my complaint.,They just send repepetitive/scripted reply if you complain through email.'The complaint had been dealt with by sending to the relevant people......we can't give you feedback for the privacy of the staff'. How will the customer know the outcome if they don't give feedback? This is very discouraging on part of the customer especially if you experienced dealing with arrogant store manager.,1
Worst company in Australia,They offer the worst service in Australia. Customer service is a joke for them. They offered me one mobile phone plan and they are charging me a completely different one. After speaking with multiple managers (everyone is called a manager of something and they are all in other parts of the world) their answer is that I'm unlucky and that I have to pay whatever they charge. Worst experience ever,1
Disgusting attitude to customers,"Bought a Mobile USB which didn't work. Attempted to have it fixed and resolutions team just ignore requests and then keep asking for information already provided 10 times over. Their only focus is how to close their file without doing anything. If you get a resolutions team member named Jacob, he is a liar and a moron.",1
I've had a great experience with Vodafone,"I've been with Vodafone for several years now, and after another great phone call with them, I've decided to post some feedback. Yes, it seems the call centre may be based outside of Aus.. so what? I've had years of good customer service, consistently. Reception is great, plans are great, I can't fault Vodafone.",5
The worst company I have ever dealt with,"I have recently moved house and vodafone sent my bill to the old address and it went missing. And they did not communicate further with me until further few months where they have put my accounts directly into default and get a debt collector company to chase me for payment and it is only for $101 that I have been paid since but they have put a default on my credit rating and it won't be cleared until 2019!! Thank you so much, that is a very poor treatment for customer and I would never recommend anyone to take on their service.",1
Worst experience ever,"Please don't do business with Vodafone , you gonna regret it as I did.they have the rudest people in the call centre and they don't listen to you . Damn I will never suggest anyone to take their service .",1
Never go with Vodafone,"Hi Vodafone teamodafone / 3 for 7-8 years now, loyal even when they cut out occasionally and can't call due to no reception. Oh wait, that doesn't show if you don't call anyone, so doesn't count in Vodafone's eyes. When I raise an issue I get pushed to the side.

If I ever moved back to Melbourne I might have gone back with Vodafone, but the service and struggle to get out of my contract is ridiculous. I hope someone in Vodafone can help me and I really hope future customers reads this post.

From an unhappy customer",1
5 star experience for me!,"I've used telstra, optus, boost mobile, virgin, and vodafone over the past 10 years, and vodafone has by far been the stand out for me. Sure, you won't get coverage like telstra and optus provide, but for those who reside in the metro area, this really isn't a concern. I've gotten the best value, and although I haven't really had too many concerns that needed dealing with over my time with them, I've found the customer service absolutely fine. Would recommend.",5
Worst customer service,"Okay I've  been with Vodafone for almost two years. recently I went to a trip to the US and before I left I turned on this 5-dollar oversea roaming feature and called to make sure it'd work for me. Well it didn't. There was full bar but every time I tried to make a call the phone always said something like ""not register on network"".ame me that I didn't turned on the data roaming feature on the phone (which i did but the problem was not able to call), then he said to me he couldn't help me because I didn't call in the US, which almost sounded like it's my fault.

Anyway Vodafone probably should train their customer service a bit better than this. Next year I am switch to Telstra.",1
"Run , Run as fast as you can ..donâ€™t look back","Just had the worst experience dealing with Vodafone India and Iâ€™m in Australia ,after trying to explain to a person in India as to why my usage was all used up with in 5 hours  the so called customer service person wanted to cancel the call after saying I was using profanity , while this call was recorders there was no profanity used at all I was so discussed by this service, to accuse me of using profanity I was discussed,  all I ask was what was sucking down my data and this was the extent of the profanity .My first call on Monday morning is to cancel my Vodafone account and go with some one that has much better customer service in Australia.",1
The Worst: Do not use Vodaphone (Zero stars -if it was an option above),"Everything about the ""service"" is bad: they overcharge, add their bills incorrectly - if they disclose them - change your plan incorrectly, their software doesn't work, they don't correct problems that arise, even after repeated requests - even with the telecommunications ombudsman involved.",1
Unstatisified,when I buy plan their condition of call are different .. When I bought it reality is different ! Unhappy with service . Getting no service .loking for another company . ..Vodafone unlimited plan is ... ?,1
Awful - be very careful,"Their prices are excellent; however, there service is rubbish. People in the stores are constantly adding services without talking to you first. Frankly they are overworked and under trained so they don't know what they are doing.  Phone support is also terrible.  It takes then weeks to accomplish simple tasked and you need to constantly follow up with them.  The problem with contacting them is you run the risk of their fix just making things more worse.  They are awful.",1
Worst provider of all. Bad customer service. Avoid at all cost!,"I have been with Vodafone for 4 years (before I switch to Telechoice) and my wife have been with them for 1.5 years (still in contract but will terminate soon!). The biggest issue they have is reception and not price competitive. I was trying to get my wife out of Vodafail since she hardly have any reception in Melbourne CBD buildings (i.e. QV, Melbourne Central station, Emporium) to the point that we can't contact each other. I had the same issue working in South Yarra when I used Vodafone. When I'm with her I have full reception with Telechoice since they use Telstra network while my wife doesn't get any reception whatsoever. We decided we've got enough of this so we requested a fair contract termination. We said we're happy to pay for the amount we owe for the phone but not for the service charge (we didn't even request compensation but fair termination) but it got rejected due to so called ""company policy"" so we have to pay the full exit fee. Very unhappy and I will never recommend this company to anyone else.",1
Horrible service coverage and even worse customer service,"If there was an option for zero stats i would give -2. The service coverage is horrific. Calls wont connect. They drop out constantly or the person on the other end can't hear you. To make matters worse, you call vodafone telling them you arent getting the service your require and they dont believe you. They come back to you with ""our intelligent analysis software tells us otherwise."" why would we wait 45mins on the line with customer care to tell them lies?? Dont even think about entering a contract with vodafone.",1
Vodafone Customer Service,Incompetent instore & supervisor customer service.  Inaccurate information led being without phone for potentially 10 working days.  Useless incompetent patronising,1
Vodafone going Good,"I like vodafone, I'll keep supporting nd be with vodafone bcz they giving much calls in reasonable price.. . .",1
Vodafone SIM card activation and customer service is slow.,When I tried to get a  new phone number and activate my new Vodafone SIM card I was told I would receive a text in about half an hour with my new phone number. After stating I needed it sooner I was told The actual time to  receive the new number would be within 24 hrs. The activation went ahead .After considering this for about an hour I rang Vodafone customer service back to say I needed to have the new phone activated  by the end of the day or cancelled. Customer service told me this was not possible and if I wanted it actioned quickly I would need to purchase a new SIM card.Why I was not offered quick activation in the first place Remains a mystery. It was difficult dealing with a customer service based in Mumbai with  a heavy foreign accent.,1
Insurance department is rip off.. DISGUSTING!!,"I lost my Iphone, which was insured.  When i contacted insurance department, I was told that I was careless and it was my fault that i lost my phone so my claim was declined. I don't know why i was paying insurance for so long when at the end of the day i was told that i was careless. The so called customer service representative( Tess and benette) called me lier and didn't even try to help me. I am still in a shock as first I lost my phone and then I was told I am CARELESS!!",1
Credit stealers,Credit stolen by Vodafone and when asked to provide evidence of investigation Vodafone could not provide this to me because I was a prepaid customer 15 gig credit gone down the drain,1
Worst reception and worst service!!,I would give a negative star rating if i could! Melbourne CBD and the reception is almost no existent and no one can help or explain why! I am paying for a useless service and really can only use the phone when connected to wifi. a gentleman in cancellations by the name of Todd was the worst customer service rep i have ever encountered and made it sound like the poor reception was my fault and was beyond rude! I will never use vodafone again after my contract has expired and I will be very vocal in letting people know this and the reason.,1
Vodafone Worst Coverage in Docklands and a Worst Customer Service,"I have been using Vodafone for past few months and recently i have moved on to my new work place in docklands. Since when I moved here I noticed that the Vodafone reception is worst to the core in indoor areas. I sit at level 10 and the response i receive from the tech support guys is ""Based on their existing frequency they can assure the coverage till 3rd or 4th floor and beyond that they cant assure"". I hardly receive any calls on my mobile when I am in my work place and when i report this issue with the customer service I have been informed that since am in a contract for 2 years i can neither disconnect now and If i do that i have to incur a huge amount. After being on a call for 2 hours hardly the customer service guys are understands my concern on the bad coverage and missing a lot of important calls on a daily basis.

Such a worst coverage and more than that a worst customer service from Vodafone.",1
Customer service no it is more like customer  abuse,"2 hours with Mumbai attempting to finish with vodafone/crazy john's  - they were rude and ran me around in circles and at one stage even had someone make horrible noises down the phone - my friend could also hear it  - 6 phone calls later no resolution -  had to speak to 2 different people in Tasmania to get things finally finalised - but then when wanted to speak to someone higher up not permitted to got the ""broken record"" routine/ could not even get a verification number or a full name - tried to find a head office  - very much concealed looks like Vodafone/Hutchinson but still elusive - cannot speak to anyone nor am I able to voice or write complaint/request for better customer service to anyone except a faceless email - not happy and would not recommend dealing with them",1
Vodapone is going downhill....,I share the same problems with  many people. Especially those who have ordered the iphone 6 since 30/9/14 and still never got it. Its now 28/10 still nothing.  Unbelievable.  I want to cancel my phone order as I feel that I have been tricked and vodaphone made false promises re delivery dates and they didnt let me. I am sick of them and will never recommend vodapone I to anyone in the future.,1
Bad customer service in bourke st melbourne,"Bad bad customer service i've ever had. He is very rude, cant talk nicely to me, always arguing even when i talk nicely. Very unsatisfied. It makes me think twice to use vodafone.",1
iPhone 6 delay Vodafone,"22/09 ordered iPhone 6 64gb Space Grey. Tracking order page informed shipping 13/10. After a few days shipping date changed to 17/11. 02/10 called Vodafone Again and got offered to change order for my iPhone 6 64gb Space Grey to a Silver version of the same model. Delivery time promised on the phone 17/10 1- 2 weeks time. Shipping date on the tracking order page same 17/10. 17/10 came and my shipping date got changed to 30/10. I started to pressure vodafone about my phone. I started to loose business due to the condition of my old phone and I was counting to receive the Phone ordered ASAP. Went to all social media possible Twitter, Facebook, Vodafone support Forum. After question them ate least 20-30 times about an specific delivery date, nobody was able to guarantee that my Phone will be sent on the 30/10. 23/10 many customers on the forum with their shipping date to 23/10 got changed to 31/10. what means that my phone will be possibly changed as well...
After being a bit persistent questioning vodafone on the support page and by email sent by their consultants. Allan put my email in the blocked list of vodafone and no messages I were sending to them were able to reach them.They were all bouncing back.
Finally after realise many other customers had the same complains them me and no good answer were given by Vodafone that made us satisfied I started to recommend on the support forum that these customers place a complaint to the TIO (Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman) when I finally got banned from the Forum page for 60 hours. 
After everybody complain about the inaccuracy of the tracking order page finally tonight the tracking order is not working at least since 11pm

Sign up,"I only signed up few days ago. As its been a a few days i thought i would call and ask what the status is with my order as i got no confirmation emails or number. I call up a guy by the name of anand answers and says its in progress. I asked him if he could send a courtesy email with details which he couldnt do and was only ready give me the details over the phone as i would always prefer to have everything in writing not bloody nonsense over a phone conversation. I insisted to get details email which he couldnt. After getting frustrated i asked to speak to a manager who was no good either ( i wonder he was classified a manager). He kept going on about giving me tracking number which i requested to be emailed to me which he as a manager didnt have access to. So i had to write it down and to find out i still have to wait 2 days to find out the details of my order. 

I wonder what more i have to deal with once i actually get my phone as the start hasnt been great.",2
Sign up,"Actually a happy customer now. It was the initial stage when they had a system issue hence the reason i didnt get any email notifications of how my new phone was tracking.
Thanks to the efficient team second time around.",2
Please please do not sign up with. Worst customer service and many failures,"Cannot describe the hardship I'm going through since switched from brilliant 3. Just adding to that, I'm from an outer suburb of Sydney just 40min drive from CBD still having coverage issues and billing issues and wrong information and rude customer service and many more... Still a Vodafail..!",1
Worst customer service,"I am working in USA, visited Delhi on Diwali vacation (2014).  My wife's number is having max limit of 1500 Rs per bill cycle. My uses is approx 1k - 2 k per day.  So paying bills daily, if bill payment delayed from my side, then no more outgoing calls.  After calling to customer care, they will not take complaint to extend the limit, simply will say, your phone will be activated in next 4 to 24 hrs, if I have paid the dues.  So many a times, important meetings are missed. Worst service, if uses are high.",1
Worst Customer Service,I have been using Vodafone more than 3 years. Today I call them regarding a billing issue and their response truly hearted me. I am looking forward to move another company.,1
at end of the contract vodafhone gave me a bad credit history!!!!!!!!,"after 4-5 years with vodafone, with direct debit, not missing a single bill i switched to telstra, 2 month later while applying for a home loan i found out that vodafone say i owe them $2000+ in my credit history check, causing me difficulties, the call center was no help, bouncing me around, telling me they'll investigate and call me back but never call. now i have to pay to get my credit history fixed. stay away.",1
Vodafone received more complaints than Telstra and Optus put together,"I rang yesterday 16th October 2014 enquiring about why I had received excess charges to my account when I had originally signed up for an 8GB plan. The girl told me that the bonus 3GB had dropped to 5GB due to a promotion that had finished.I informed her that I was unaware of this & mentioned that I don't want to be paying the same $80 plan for a 5GB service.cause I did not want to calling back before the end of my contract asking the same questions.

She assured me that I would be getting 8GB per month for the remaining contract on a $100 plan.

So after explaining all the details, I then asked her to go ahead and upgrade to the 8GB $100 plan.

So today 19th October 2014 I received an email informing me of my new 6GB $100 plan.
",1
yes,"Vodaphone are the worst customer service for so many reasons i dont want to start typing that.I am an ex 3 customer for 8 or so years, customer service was excellent, and coverage in rural south australia was identical with vodaphone. Vodaphone take them over and are 100% hopeless, and there coverage is about 10% of telstra in rural sa!!!!! I recomend you dont wast your time, and especially your money with this ""cowboy' phone provider. Asia are way more ""on the ball"" with phones, yet vodaphone use india, and they still cant provide any service??????????? Even then. Give 3 back please vodaphone!!!!!!",1
The absolute worst customer service experience of my life,"Been with Vodafone for 3 years. Innumerable complaints and the worst, most confrontational customer service department ive ever had to deal with. Literally counting the days till i can cancel my account. No stars",1
Terrible service,"I do not have good experiences with the service every time I call. Even as I speak I'm told to hold the phone and wait 25mins in order to cancel my mobile broadband account. They can't call me back. When I ask if there's any other way of cancelling (e.g. written), I was told that there is no other way. This is really unacceptable! Now I have 25mins to fume about how bad the service.",1
Good to be back....,"I was with Vodafone from around 2006 to around 2011 which was around the infamous Vodafail days.  A new job for a period of time saw me move to the Telstra network and then when that changed in 2013, I continued with Telstra.  I disliked Telstra, I found their pricing expensive, plans inflexible and their online customer management systems appalling.  Tired of what was on offer, I went to Boost as it was still on the Telstra network and included 3gb of data and unlisted voice and tex for $40.  The data amount then reduced to 2gb.  The frustrating thing with boost is you are not able to get a receipt for your purchases each month to claim on expenses.  Incredible.  The only way round it was to keep a purchase receipt From a top-up purchase but I wanted it all automated with a bill to down load or emailed to me.  I should add that all I required was a sim only plan.  I have a Google nexus 5 phone that I bought direct from Google.

There was no way I was ever going to Telstra and Optus's plans didn't seem attractive either.  There was Amaysim and I almost went there however then came Vodafone's new Red Plans.  $50 with 3gb on 4g, unlimited calls and text, 300 min included international, $5 per day roaming from your plan, and no lock in contract.  Additional data if requred is only $10.  How can I go wrong.

I visited the retail store in Sydney CBD and the experience was fantastic.  This was an entirely different Vodafone from the days gone by and they had me up and running on my new plan keeping my old number in no time at all.  As for managing your account, there's a fantastic app with a great user friendly dashboard so you can track your data usage easily.

I've taken the phone to Queenstown in NZ and Byron Bay and can honestly say I have had no noteworthy network issues.  The roaming was great in Queenstown and I've had decent high speed 3G on Wategos beach in Byron!  Sydney metro has been great and to be fair, I keep my phone on 3G unless I really need the speed which is blazing.

So far so good.  If like me are stuck for a decision, there's nothing to be lost in going with Vodafone and all to gain.  I've had no need to call customer service so cannot speak for the quality of the service there but quite frankly, all seems to be managing itself too easily without the need.

The new red plans must be the best plans around on a considerably improved network.  Will update in 3 months.  Score is 4.5.",5
They continued charging me even after I cancelled my service.,"They were charging me $10 a month after I cancelled my service. I noticed this once, assumed it was a once off, and left it. I noticed it a second time several months afterwards, called up to sort it out. After 26 minutes worth of being transferred around to various people, I finally got onto a guy that sorted it out. The cost of the call was 90c a minute. .90*26= $23.40. Jerks.",1
Poorest customer service I've ever dealt with,"Poor service technical and help, constantly overcharged rude staff. One staff ""claimed"" to be the manager after I was put on hold the same lady picked up claiming to be the manager! DO not use this company you will regret it!",1
Walk away. Don't even think about it!,"Terrible terrible telco! Order process, customer service.. all a piece of joke! If you have extra energy, sign up with them!",1
Unbelievably poor service!! Don't join even if there was no other mobile companies on eart!,"No mention about the poor package they offer, the customer service is even worse! And be careful if you want to terminate the service with them, they are gonna play on you! Call them on the exact day when you want to terminate, ask them to disconnect the service and stop talking to them straight after. Be prepared that you will be transferred to a specific department to carry out this request, and it's gonna be a looooong waiting time (not sure why they do this). What a rubbish!!! Poor communication and extremely unprofessional! This kind of service just doesn't fit in modern society!",1
Excellent service,I have always had the best service from Vodafone! I have just signed up for a third 2 year contract and my new iPhone 6 is on its way. The customer service guy was so helpful and courteous. He even got me a $7 monthly saving off the advertised contract price. Love Vodafone!,5
Don't sign up/Leave Now. No stars.,"They will charge you money whenever possible. Changed company provider finally, and they billed me $13 for one day with the data turned off.",1
Didn't know every one I knew changed from them years ago. Customer service is deplorable,"If you have an issue, the last thing they seem to want you to do is to call them. I was directed to MyVodafone community and forums and wasted hours trying to find out the simplest of details.  Manual setup of mms etc was required which I have never struck before",2
"Terrible, don't go with Vodafone, you will regret !","Please listen to others before decide to chose vodafone, they have the worst service in Australia, but its not just that, they will rip you off badly without you know. I received the shocking bills of +200$ on a 30$ monthly plan, they will deduct from your credit card. they are a bunch of thieves. I do not know why people still chose their plans while they have this bad reputation. again I'm telling you; if you choose vodafone, you will regret and you will count the days for your contract to be over and get rid of them. Vodafone you are the worst.",1
Bad Customer service,"That true , vodafone customer service is very bad , my wife wants change a red  sime plane $50 , the main things 300 minutes international rates . We try to her's transfer exciting numer with contact 1555 , or triable , when we contacted , all answer from inida. , so many times ring they didin't understand what to do . So we went dandenog plaz store ,two times , they same , after iphone 6 arrived so many customers inside the store. But there is no good customer service, we explain but one sale girl tolds us you come tomorrow .U ring customer service.,orther wise they did't know how to talk to customers . So we really unhappy .

We keep our older service provider. I think they give cheap rate because the vodafone coverage is not good. Keep watching before move vodafone.",1
Worst customer service and commitment to customers!!!,"I bought into a contract with vodafone, biggest mistake ever!!! My phone simply slid off a bed which was about 30-40cm high and completely died! It had a protective cover on it!! Vodafone was no help at all. My galaxy s5 was two-three weeks old! They suffeled me from one person to another and only to any wasted my time because they did not provide me with any assistance, they just keep making me say the same thing over and over gain and they keep saying the same thing. They just say they will repair it for $300.00. I am hoping that the ombudsman (tio) can help me. All customers of crazy johns be ware as they are offering deals don't be fooled.
The original plan was good but means nothing when you don't back it up with service.
No Warranty service!",1
"VODAFONE IS TERRIBLE, DO NOT JOIN!!!","Vodafone is one of the worst networks I have been on. Never have I been so ripped off and had such terrible customer service on a network. DO NOT JOIN, HIGHLY UNRECOMMENDED. nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nn nnnothingeverything",1
Vodafone is Terrible,"Ive been with vodafone for so many years, this time i bought an adds on and thought it would cover my international call. But they said the couuntry is not included and theats made my charges way over too much!They could not help me with that misleading ads, all they could over only payment extension.",1
Terrible customer service!,"I recently joined Vodafone and was excited to start my new contract with them, however, I was shocked at how bad the customer service was. I wanted to enquire about altering the contract by paying off the handset fees, however, I was forced to speak to 6 people over an almost 3 hr period to ask how I could make a payment. I was even told by 3 gentlemen that I needed to improve my English as they couldn't understand me, which isn't helpful when your speaking to people based in Mumbai, India, where accents can be difficult to understand at times..

I was told that I could cancel my contract and no fees would be required, yet a week later my contract has still not been cancelled. Even after spending another 2 hrs on the phone today explaining that I had cancelled the contract, I was told ""We understand your frustration,"" and offered a Credit. We had agreed to cancel the contract yet the ""manager"" had left no notes on the account to indicate this. There are early exit clauses on my contract, yet for whatever reason, Vodafone refuses to honour them and will continue to charge me for a service that I'm not using, as I was instructed to return all products back to them. I haven't even activated the SIM card and they want to charge me...

Please be very careful when joining Vodafone. Their network has improved slightly but their customer service is woeful and appalling. They say lots of nice things but actually do very little to help you. I have now wasted 6 hrs trying to rectify this problem and who knows how many hours left to go...
Slightly improved network
Terrible customer service. Issues with understanding English at call centres.",1
"Join vodafone pre paid if you enjoy being over charged,ripped off, enjoy being transferred to 10 dif","Pick an issue...any issue, you name it vodafone has caused it for me over 10yrs...yes I know I should of switched along time ago..what if the other provided is worse?lol...so A to Z vodafone has failed me... Just don't bother with them....good god put your money away and run...now and don't look back-",1
Really unhappy with the service recieved and faulty phone,"Recieved my phone Nokia Lumia 1320 2 mths ago. Had constant issues with plugging the charger in, was stiff and had to gently wiggle it, got repeatedly worse so took it back. The unqualified for techinical issues sales assistant, determined I had done it, end of story so wont fix it, and voided my entire warranty. This phone is 2mths old,. been stiff from the beginning and No idea by looking at it for a few seconds, without taking it apart has determined that I did it and wont cover it, phone help was useless, they were not really interested and I still have a 2 yr contract despite me telling them that there are HEAPS of nokia lumias on review sites having this issue with plugging in the charger and a broken connector in the phone, but deems it MY fault??? will never return to vodafone again and cannot wait until my contract ends.
Love my phone however not the customer service
Warranty voided as the sales assistent decided I had damaged inside a phone which she hadnt took apart and hadnt looked at techincally, as well as a sales assistant telling me that they autmatically deemt hat kind of fault as damage by consumer, ignoring the fact that heaps of people online have the same complaints!",1
Constant internet interruptions and weak speed,"Despite being living near Melbourne cbd   I constantly get weak reception for Internet, changed frequently between 4g to h+ to h. No stable 4g network. I reckon it's not my phone as it's ok with other networks and I buy it from vodafone centre. Yeah they do usually held promotions and stuff but their internet service sucks anyway.",2
Vodafone is the perfect example of why we should all use a reputable carrier,"Vodafone you are driving me insane .  I seriously feel like having a celebration party at the end of my contract. I have been with Vodafone for 10 years and my partner 15 years and the service in the past 2 years has been absolutely rubbish.hem (most of that time has been spent waiting on hold listening to that strange song that they've had for over a year) and it almost always leads to a dead end. I actually feel sorry for their staff for having to work for a company who holds no value in their customers.

Please listen to your customers who are all leaving you and take notes from other phone carrier companies out there.",1
Network is getting better. But customer service over their offshore call centre needs improvement,"I noticed that the Vodafone network service is definitely much better, following their recent 4G rollout.  If there's anything that they need to improve on is their offshore call centre service.  I don't believe that it's doing them any good.  Based on my resent engagement with their 1555 telephone support, I highly recommend for senior management to strategically consider using another offshore contact centre with a reputation on professional customer service with excellent communication skills.Mobile network is getting better.  Highly competitive and value for money.Current offshore call centre service.  Senior management needs to seriously consider using another country which has excellent communication skills and customer service.",2
Very bad service,"I was with Vodafone for sometime. The service in Lyndhurst area is so poor that the sound is either muffled or keeps dropping. Inside house it is worse. Complained and tried to cancel the contract for poor service but they said that I couldn't cancel the service no matter how poor it is because I started the contract when in noble park and moved to Lyndhurst afterwards. I though had made enquiry about Lyndhurst because I was already building the house when I took the service and knew I was moving in 3-4 months. They just refused that I had communication with the customer service about it and acts ignorant. 

 They also tries to dupe customer and get money until they make complaint. I was given bonus data for 12 months and after 12 months when I presumed that the data would be gone, they keep charging you extra money for that stating it is our responsibility to cancel it when in the pack that I received initially nothing was mentioned. It only says ""Bonus 500MB of data for first 12 months"". I will report this to ACCC.

Their customer service is also very rude. They don't improve the service for years and charge us full money but when I was late for couple of days for payment because I forgot the deadline, they just charged me 10$ late fee. No other company does that. I was late with optus before, but was never charged a fine. Also they don't have good service like sms alert for deadlines like we have with many other service.

They don't care about customers. They try to hassle you. When I complained about poor service in my area, they asked me to do detailed troubleshooting even though I told them that I have two phones from Vodafone which both of them have same issue while I have no issues at other places including my previous stay at noble park. They also can check the dropped calls from my phone service that I am using but just persistently says do troubleshooting, change sim, record each issues with date and time and then we will look into it. 

Very very rude and ignorant of our needs. Never ever going to take it again. I will also provide this feedback to all my family members and friends.

Poor customer service, very bad service, extra charges",1
Mistakes happen but the service team is happy to assist and get the problem sorted. Pretty happy!,"Hey guys, people often blame Vodafone but I've been with them for 5 years and just got a new contract for my partner and myself for another 2 years. I live in Sydney CBD and dont have any problems with the network. Even travelling within regional NSW and QLD I have the reception in most places. Yes, I have to call from time to time because some mistakes with the account happen but I never was left disappointed with their service. I'd  recommend this company.Ready to help and polite.You need to keep an eye on your bills to avoid surprise charges and explain to the customer service team clearly what you need.",4
terrible!! worst provider ever come across,"Massive stuff up with crazy johns to Vodafone switch. Told one thing from vodafone store staff and another from customer service, and when rang again to speak to customer service they were no help at all. Never even activated my sim but expected to pay cancellation fee. Not with them now and definitely never will be.",1
Vodafone,"Time to edit  again. Up from 1 star to 3.  They have fixed bill shock due to excessively high excess data rates. They have fixed their plans.Would I recommend them? Yes. They offer the best value at the moment. Personally, I have  found customer service to be good. Network is good at 3220.   (Check  coverage in your area first if you are thinking of trying them.)(3 stars is the maximum I will give any telco at the moment)Value for money.  network at 3220. customer service",3
NEVER AGAIN WITH VODAFONE - NEVER!!!!!,"I have been a long time customer of Vodafone but over the last 2 year term of my contract they have almost driven me to the point of insanity! I Poor network coverage, which occasionally works as it should, then starts playing up where calls drop out and I have to keep redialling, does not work properly out of town for me, very slow and frustrating internet, every time I call to report a problem - and this can be verified - I am on the phone for at least between 1 and 1 and a half hours!! I am sick of the operators from the call centres speaking like robots repeating the same scripts without actually listening and providing help for what I need, an example of this is I have asked for what plan is most suited for my usage level several times, because my bills have been coming at $500+ a month despite being on a $69plan with added data!!!! and the wrong advice given to me cost me thousands of dollars! I have been ripped off because of this as far as im concerned and I will be taking the matter to the Telco ombudsman. From the operators i get the impression they could not care less about what im saying, they can be cocky because they believe their company is so big, and losing me makes no difference, that's how I feel after speaking to them. I don't recommend Vodafone, they have made me feel stupid for being a customer with them, I will pay a little more and get proper service and network coverage from another carrier.

terrible service, poor coverage, arrogant, expensive",1
Worse of the Wose Phone service ever,"I have had 3 vodaphone service since last 3 years and they have made complete mess by mixing up the account and putting outstanding amount on my bills. I was up to date with the bills so far and when I have closed 2 of the services, they have placed unjustifyable outstanding amount which doubling up in my bills. Without any notifications, they have put a permanent bar on my phone..",1
Not happy,"OMG Vodafone. I speak to you more about my bill then I speak to my friends. You need to get your act together. I got 2 phones from you for my teenage daughters. I gave my bank details for the direct debit. The details were recorded wrong so the payment do not go though. So I rang and checked the details that were wrong and gave them the correct details. They said the payment would happen next month with the next payment. I was happy for them to take the payment now but they said no it would happen next month. Then about a week before Vodafone  were to take the payment Vodafone turned off my children's phones. I did not ring Vodafone because they were going to take the payment in a few days anyway. The day before my account was due I got a phone call from Vodafone asking me to pay my account. I told them that it was going to be direct debit tomorrow at their request. 

I said I would not be paying it today because they would get there money tomorrow. I asked if they could turn my children's phones back on now. They checked with the supervisor and this was done. Then I received a e mail saying the direct debt did not work again. So I paid the account straight away on my credit card. I rang Vodafone to make sure I did not get paid a fee for the direct debit not going though. I was told that I would not be charged a fee.I explained that it was not my fault  because I had enough money in the bank to cover the payment. The next bill come and I was charged the fee so I rang asking for the fee to be credited. I was told the fee would not be credited until I could show Vodafone my bank statement that I had enough money in my account. I was not very happy to say the least. I said I would pay the bill less the fee. Vodafone said that this was fine. 

I made sure that my children's phones would not be turned off due to not paying the full account. Vodafone told me that there phones would not be turned off. I asked again as we were heading overseas the next day. Well when we arrived back they  turned my children's phones off again. OMG Vodafone what you say and what you do are two different things. I will not waste my time talking to you anymore. I went to the Vodafone store and they sorted it for me. The staff at the store rang on my behalf and got the amount credited. Once the contracts on the 2 phones are finished I will never use Vodafone again. Never again.",1
Terrible service,Terrible services. Never sign contract with them again. It doesn't matter how many departmentsyou contact and seek for help. They only keen on take money out of your account every month. Handset goes wrong? sorry! out of guarantee. Talk to Samsung technician directly.attactive promotion but terrible customer services.They don't care of customers only care of their money.,1
After 18 years of loyality,"Got to say this we have been with voda for 16 years the service hasnt been perfect but i still thought it can only get better as they promise,yeh right. In previous years as we know it hasn't been perfect but over the years they were able to assist you which ever way possible.Well not this time couple of months ago back they were experiencing problem so somehow i didn't recieve my email .So i took it upon myself to call possibly before 23 june 14  about may bill due by 23 june. Bill cause it was taking longer this time.I should've called much earlier but as we know life takes over and we rely on reminders anyway i called as we know the call centre in india no comment.To let them know i didn't recieve so the person jason told me that day they will send again that was before due date the problem was i was away  and couldn't pay til yesterday 8 july 14  as i need to use a barcode i don't like paying direct debit.

I mention to the bloke that i don't want to pay a late $10 fee cause this hasn't been the first time it's happened before he mentioned that if it does just call to have it reversed.Few days back another bill came with last amount plus new july acc stating i need to pay late one asap.I also noticed i had incurred a $10 late fee on junes bill.When i rang i spoke to a person and they said because i had had a waive in nov 13 i could not get another what a lot of hog wash. Mind you it was for the same problem no email.It seemed that i wasn't going to get anywhere with this person spoke to another then finally a supervisor by the name of alex he again didn't seem to concerned about my concern and kindly said if i didn't like it to take it up with ombudsman in other words bad luck.He made it clear that it was voda big chief pretty much want ppl to suck it up .It was beyond their control.I stated that i would speak to someone else so he pretty much made it clear no matter who i speak to the verdict is the same.

Anyway i only payed my late one,mays bill.Other bill due end of july this has the late fee .I tried ringing again this morning 9. 7.14 to see if some one else would hear my complaint no way it was quite clear i was wasting my time. Anyway just to recap, i pay $120 a month for two fones now voda chief think they are doing the right thing by advising ppl to suck it up just shows poor management.Lets remember it only $10 they could of waived now for that,$10 i will certainly cancel our contract once it runs out in a couple of months.So voda smart logic (not) company will loose $120 for us now that's buisness as voda seems after 16 years of loyality even though they were going through tough time media and always paying my bill i get this treatment . Good one voda management.Someone better start to listen to the customers for we make up your buisness.Yours kindly unsatisfied customer .",1
Terrible company and bad service.,Bad customer service. I end up paying money for those things which i was not even adviced from a customer care agent. I would never let ny of my close friends and gamily take this service.No network at most places yet you end up payong more money than other networks .,1
Vodafone is a rip off,"With vodafone for years on renewal i got 2 new apple phones with 4g.I was not told anything about the download rate for 4g .. For some reason we went over in our cap the first time for 10 yrs .. Sonething that never happened before vodafone wanted over $1500 more they demanded payment straight away i offered $25 a werk they wanted $100 i was desperated i'm a widow with 3 young kids..After a mix up in the mastercard payments i got an email which sai heads up unless you pay in 10 days youc will be blocked..They blocked both phones i work for a charity for no  pay so i had to go to another company so they then put the ccc onto me now i have to deal with threats if i dont pay they give me a bad financial report that company is harder than vodafone now im so weak its intollerable all over such a small amount initially now its $4000.00 and i'm a widow..  What do i do now..Don't do vodafone.

Rudeness ruthlessness coldness nasty",1
"What impressed me most about Vodafone NZ, my first impressions","I originally was with Telecom about seven years ago and I decided to try another cellular carrier ( Vodafone NZ ) at first I thought this was a bad move but over a period of time I was impress with my first impressions.of things that hasn't changed is there are no shortage of Vodafone outlets within the Wellington region and if you ever needed assistants with mobile related matters well this is certainly a bounce.

Taking the stress out of anything mobile related, well I'm the sort of person who likes to pay someone else to do the things that frustrate me like installing screen protectors or anything else mobile related and this is one area where Vodafone NZ have impress me except for the employee who tried to give me his secret tip to making chicken couscous.

What impress me the most about Vodafone NZ is that they continue to deliver what I expect and this is probably why I like their Service.
Excellent customer service, always helpful and friendly, vast range of mobile phones, deals & promotions,  plenty of Vodafone outlets within the Wellington region.",5
"Huge phone bills, bad service, can't speak to anyone in Australia,  no compassion stay away","Corprate thugs with no compassion, son has a $10 plan & receives a tex free internet.

Loyal customer for more than 12 yrs never missed a payment with 4 phones. Tried to disconnect 4 phones & at last put thru to Australia, thinking I would get some understanding. Wrong, even though I am authorised on the account with the pin they wouldn't let me terminate. Hard, mean company & I will do everything in my power including talking to the media to let people know how they prey on people with a $10 plan especially the young.",1
Not even worth rating,"I recommend noone go with vodafone plans.i wasnt told when I signed up that the charges would be so high.i have spoken to vodafone in relation to my plan and all I get is you need to increase your monthly spend. I make less calls than my friend on a eqivalent plan with optus and she actually never goes over her monthly spend and uses her phone more than I do. To avoid any hassles don't sign up.Nothing absolute rip offhonestly the high call costs, customer service, terrible connection",1
This is not the phone coverage for you,"If you live in Adelaide and you can't even make a simple call,  no reception and don't get me started on the country, don't bother taking your phone unless you need an alarm clock because that is all your phone will be good for. I am sorry for the people who work there and hate for a company to go under but seriously this company needs to disappear. I have had a guts full and can't wait to finish the worst contract in history. Most of the money on my bills is due to ringing everyone 15 times just to say hi, I will tell as many people as I can not to join as they won't let me leave the contract as I live in Adelaide and they think the coverage is fine (think again).",1
no coverage inside home,i live in morwell and on 2 year contract with vodafone. using latest galaxy s4 phone (4g).... instead of getting 4g coverage i dont even get any coverage inside home. vodafone is the worst network provider u can use. i compained so many times but they dont care. it is my worst mistake ever. they charge u like any other provider but in return u get bad service.nothingalmost everything,1
Worst Company.. Total waste of money,Very poor network - serviceif you dont be able to contact anyone for half day... even their customer service center from any other network...Its not their fault.They are happy to compansate it for $2. on over couple thousand dollars loss due to their network..Not even a sorry....,1
Worst Mistake Ever,"I ordered my new service from Vodafone on Thursday evening. Its been 2 days, still the service is not active. Every time I call the customer service or shop where i got the service from what they tell me is that the number is still porting it will be done between 5 mins or 3 hours maximum. Its been 2 days without any service at all. So far I have not received any service at all from you guys rather than waiting on the phone for hours or calling the shop where they never ever pick up the phone. I feel like one of the worst things I ever done in my life was signing up for a contract with Vodafone.

I really wish I can cancel my service. I cant even call it a service since I havent received any at all

I really should have thought once moreâ€¦worst bloody mistake i ever done.
No Service at all
Everything",1
Excellent coverage now after 2 years of bad coverage,"I have been with Vodafone 6 years. After 2 years contract with 3 i switched to Vodafone and problems with Data coverage. They offered me credit and unloked my modem so i could use other network sim card in it. After 21 months and got renewed with new plan, from then on absolutely no problem with coverage. I enjoy 4G when my sis and bro with other provider have only 3G coverage. After 2 years i am a happy customer.Reliable, inexpensive, faster speed with 4G.2011 and 2012 worst coverage",5
Vodafone Ripoff: $2100 in 24 hours,"Please, please - don't get ripped off by Vodafone.Our complaint is being reviewed by the TIO (Telecoms Ombudsman). Let me know if you want to know what happens.
4G data - it really is pretty fast
It's a set up for a big STING",1
Device Issue,One of the worst service provider. Bad warranty service. Big cheater. better not to go with vodafone. Problem with the device just in one month. People are not helping to fix the issue. Always frustrating customer while providing service. Will never recommend anyone to go with vodafone. Better to try other service provider.,1
The customer is never right,"I have two phone numbers with Vodafone that cost me over $120 per month, and I was previously with 3 which Vodafone closed down.I called them to find out why I suddenly had a bill of over $747.  Of course it was myfault because I had bought a new Samsung Galaxy S4 online (nice phone btw).  The early upgrade fee was noticed by neither me nor my partner who was assisting me when I purchased it, however Vodafone assured me that it was quite clear.Not wishing to upset A on Vodafone care 1555 I managed to get the supervisor B and upset him instead, then I got escalated to the manager C.  I then got handed over to accounts who offered me three weekly payments.  It was a complete waste of an hour of my life.  
All I can do is put it down to experience and take my business elsewhere.
I had two affordable phones, that had mostly good reception.
Ambiguous online information",2
The customer is never right,"In October I broke my contract with Vofafone and paid them out as required.  I have been a customer of Optus since about 2001,  and they continue to look after me.  2 phones and broadband at the moment.",2
The customer is never right,Optus is going really well for me.  Never again Vodafone.,2
The customer is never right,"Just paid my Optus bill $167.00.  Not bad for two phones with virtually unlimited calls and 200min of international.  10GB of data, and broadband to the house.  Had this system in place for 18 months now and my partner and I are extremely happy.  Just got a new phone outright from Becextech online and another one in Malaysia.  Would never go back to Vodafone.  I don't give second chances",2
Not Happy with upgraded plan,Received call for phone upgrade and was told my data and credit will remain same. now when i got my first bill after upgrade they reduced the credit from $550 to $500. I feel like cheated not happy and vodafone please deliver what you say don't cheat your consumers. Anyway thanks for nothing.Customer service representatives full of frauds.,1
HTC one replacement is Samsung Galaxy S3 without batteries.,"My husband is with vodafone over 4 years now. No doubt we like the deals they offer. problem comes when as an old customer we expect them to be good. but it looks as if they take old customers for granted.recently  my husband was on $60 plan on which they gave rebate of $5. he opted for HTC one. the phone didn't work well so he has to visit vodafone centre. they never had new HTC for replacement, they took phone and gave some other phone for the time being. after 2-3 weeks he get a refurbished HTC one, again the phone didn't work well. nearly 2 -3 times he had problem with the HTC they gave.
lately they said that they don't have HTC one so they gave Samsung Galaxy S3 which was on $30 (one of his friend has on this plan) or $40 plan. And to our surprise samsung galaxy s3 was sent without battery. they degraded phone and no batteries. 
when my husband spoke with their customer service they said to either accept the phone (degraded) or leave the contract, not something that i expect from vodafone. 
also vodafone centre (where my husband went) tried to contact and complain of the situation,but  they didn't get back nor they took any notice. 
It has been a complete waste of time and money.
call and data plans
their unfair nature towards old customers",2
This is too slow,Vodafones reception is soooo slow I just wanna throw my phone out the window,1
No Reception At work (on A business contract),"Dont bother - we warned,  I am on a business contract and have almost a 10% drop out rate at my place of work on a business contract.  They only calculate it from your home address and place of work means nothing.  No one willing to help or give me an answer, losing business, cant make or take calls unless in the street.   Has taken 7 days to speak to the right person and the most they can do is ""allow"" to pay out my contract...how nice.  Dealing with morons and not worth the hassle. Pay more and go with a provider that has coverage.",1
Horrible Provider,"Pathetic excuse of a service provider.Barely travel outside of inner city Melbourne, yet constantly dropping in an out of service.Staff are rude, and incompetent.Considerably behind in terms of service, when compared to Telstra.Long time customer due to the low cost, but now that Telstra have comparative prices, its a no brainer.For an extra couple of dollars a month I've switched to Telstra with no regrets.You get way you pay for with Vodafone, rubbish service, rubbish staff, zero appreciation.",1
Big disapppointment,"Me and my wife are with Vodafone for over five years but now desperately waiting for my contract to over and switch to another network. We get very poor indoor reception in our area. When contacted Vodafone, I spoke to bunch of rude customer service consultants who advised there is nothing they can do and the only option I have is to discontinue the service. Now we are being forced to pay for cancellation costs due to the fact the Vodafone cannot give me service I signed for. I was given an offer to pay certain amount and switch to another network but when I spoke to them today again, I was advised offer has been expired and Vodafone will re assess my situation when I switch to new network and i may have to pay a lot higher than previous offer.
The big let down is their call center staff. No one is ready to help and you feel like they are doing a favor on you by taking your call. 
Vodafone has lost two customers forever.",1
Charged for services that i have asked not to have,When i upgraded my contract i had insurance on my old phone i was asked if i wanted to continue this service and i stated that i did not want to continue with the insurance as i felt i did not need it on this new phone i spoke with a vodafone customer service person last night and was informed that i had infact been being charged for this insurance for the past 13 months i asked him to cancel the insurance straight away and he said he would which in fact he didnt and that the past 13 months at $11 per month would be credited back onto my vodafone account. I called vodafone customer service today to check that everything had been put into place and was informed that the insurance had never been canceled as i was told that it would the previous night and i was also told that the amount that i had paid unknowingly would not be able to be credited to my account and that they had no record of the opperator saying that it would but were not willing to bring up the recording of the conversation where i had been told all this information. This is not the first time that i have been charged for services from vodafone that i have been told would be automatically cut off or services that i have specifically told them that i dont want. They have poor customer service.,1
Worst company to deal with!!!!,Overseas call centers... Extra charges.... Poor reception.... Bad customer service.I do not recommend this company to anyone!Every time i have interaction with this company i feel like strangling them.Can't wait to return to a reputable service provider like Telstra. Steer clear of Vodafone.Very poor company.... Stay away!,1
Worst reception in the world,"I can't even begin where to start. I am paying $55 a month for a mobile service that can't even send a simple text message when I am in my own room. I am absolutely appalled by the network coverage provided by Vodafone. I hardly ever hear my phone ring even when I have it in my hand and it goes straight to voicemail. I can't make phone calls at all, I have to try numerous times and when I do manage to connect it rings a few times then cuts off. When I am talking my voice automatically cuts off like 5 seconds later and the person on the other end can't hear me at all yet I can clearly hear what they are saying. This will have 99% of the time. I cannot use the net when I'm out as there is no connection. I have never exceeded my data limit at all and I have never exceeded my minutes because I can't even use it. Nothing wrong with my phone, it's Vodafone I tell you. At times I even struggle to call my home phone from my mobile when I am sitting right next to the handset. Shocking. Unfortunately I am trapped in a 24 month contract and I tell you as soon as I get off it I am never ever going back to this company again. I was originally with 3 to start with but the two companies merged and I didn't have a clue that Vodafone is this bad. I would not recommend anyone anything to do with Vodafone, it's expensive, it's not worth your money it's not with anything. I'm not the type to write long ranting reviews but this is just utterly ridiculous! Not even worth 1 star.",1
vodafone worst ever,"Unbelievably bad coverage. When I go to Tasmania no coverage outside of CBD areas of Launceston and Hobart. No coverage even at Launceston airport. Routinely unable to send text messages to 50% of my contacts (unhelpful ""customer service"" staff unable to explain this). Unreliable internet slow and often drops out. Can't wait to return to a reputable service provider like Telstra. Steer clear of Vodafone.Absolutely nothingWhere do you want me to start?",1
"Worst, unethical company I've ever interacted with.","I do not recommend this company to anyone!parently a resolve), there was no way i was using that amount of data! I do have a it back ground, i am not stupid! I know what is being used and what is not, i had data counters on my devices and i was under my 18gb. Then they had the hide to tell me i was on a 16gb plan, i am wtf, every time i have interaction with this company i feel like strangle them. I wish them a slow and painful death!",1
"Worst, unethical company I've ever interacted with.","Well that is interesting, after posting this, I just got yet a email bill from vodafone, been years since I've used them. Shame on you Vodafone!!! We should all invoice Vodafone for our time and frustration we endured with our dealings. 

I AM NOT GOING TO PAY IT! TAKE ME TO COURT! I LOOK FORWARD TO IT!",1
Worst company to share your private information with government agencies allows them to spy on you,"The worst company ever. The worst reception. If you want to downsize a plan even you are on the highest plan they will tell you that you have to pay money, i can understand if you are on a low plan you pay but if you are on the highest plan you need to pay to downsize your plan. The worst reception ever 9 out of 10 you won't be able to call as you will always get a response of no service or sos only. Pathetic.Plus if you don't answer a certain call they will call you and ask you why aren't you answering a certain number!!  What the hell!! It is not their business!!  It makes me wonder they are a spying company as well.
Save your money!! Save your time!! They are nice to take your money!! But when you have problems they don't know you!!

everything is wrong with it",1
Dramatic improvement in Vodafone!,"Moombai call centre staff were good compared to shocking Telstra contact centre in Manilla who don't help.  Voda coverage in Melb CBD and Melb Western suburbs is excellent! 4G service is really fast!  Call quality compared to a few years ago is majorly improved.  Online portal is fantastic to manage services online too.Online portal, call centre staff were surprisingly good, good call quality",5
Vodafone customer service -They left me waiting for their callback until 11pm,"Vodafone Customer service left me hanging till late night for a call that they promise to do and never happened. I asked for the manager and they say he was on the phone so I asked to wait and after half an hour they say he will call me back in less than two hours. It was around 8 pm so I waited until 11pm and they never come back to me. Socking!! I felt a big idiot for waiting but I did not want them to wake my family at night. It was an urgent matter. Do you know what they said the next day when ""I"" called? ""Sorry for the inconvenience""That my contract with them is finishing in a few months. By Vodafone welcome TelstraWorst service ever. Disrespectful. Unhelpful.",1
New customers are offered with lower prices then current loyal customers,"1. My partner has been a customer of Vodafone for 6 years or more.2. He upgraded a few months ago to 100$ 5GB red plan (highest data plan available)3. Saw that they have the 100$ red plan with 10 GB of data 2 days ago4. Called to see if they could upgrade my package to give me the same thing new customers will get.5. Answer was: NO. sorry. new customers only. you can add  boosters and pay more to get the same amount of data as a new customer. I cant even upgrade as they will charge me cancellation fees of current  years contract to then re sign up with Vodafone to get this promotion. 
6. He pays 100$ a month on the red plan to get 5GB and also adds boosters and still goes over. It is ridiculous that Vodafone can actually put in so many barriers/loop holes to prevent current paying customers to get a deal that a non Vodafone customer has.  

Question:
Why can't Vodafone match current offers for loyal long time customers who call in an request it (obviously not to everyone, but if a customer is intelligent enough to shop around and see this, then take the time to call in)? I don't mind resigning a 2 years contract from today's date to get that 10GB 100$ plan but I will not pay Vodafone hundreds of dollars to cancel my old contract with them to get a new contract with them. 
Summary:
The worst phone company, I have ever dealt with not just in Australia, but World wide",1
Charged for services never used,I was billed for 8 months via direct debit for a business phone service that was not used because l had changed companies. It should have been cancelled when l had changed carriers but was still getting billed for a service that was never used and Vodafone was very aware of that because they could see my usage charges were zero. Unfortunately for me my Vodafone billing was overlooked until my partner picked up on the error. I made 4 lengthy phone calls to managers who were basically saying bad luck there is nothing we can do. Getting charged for a service that was meant to have been cancelled when the contract ended and never used but continued to be billed and not compensated has made me never want to deal with Vodafone again. This matter will now go to the telecommunications ombudsman,1
Costumer service,"One i had to wait 20 minutes to talk to real people i dont want to talk to a stupid computer than they didnt even help out with my situation. They always sending messages at the wrong time and barring my internet for know reason. The service is rubbish and so i the costumer serivce i recommend that no one in their right mind ever chooses to go with vodafone and if you do good luck because all it is, is constant problems.",1
OMG,"I moved interstate and the network was killing me and my housemates. Facing call dropouts, network unavailability and no internet connections. Had no networks on both my ipad and my phone for the whole morning one particular day and i called Vodafone customer care.. And more trouble started..dont know my own number. After a couple of attempts he managed to enter my number right(thank god) and then transferred me to another department again!!

I was 1 hour 35 minutes in the phone without any leads and was getting frustrated when this rude guy answered and after explaining him my problem ( god knows how many times did i explain that day) told me that i was not facing any problems and the system said everything is perfect.

I gave all my housemates number and said that these numbers have been reporting their problems too and the guy argues that i am just making a scene and i am not facing problems. I ask to speak to the supervisor.. He keeps me in long hold and says the supervisor will be contacting me in 24-72 hrs since he is on the call with other customer.. I insisted  on waiting and all of a sudden i was kept in hold and after two minutes he is on the other side again..

I just disconnect the phone.

It is still on the market",1
Three customer to Vodafone,I used to be a happy Three customer until Vodafone took over.     I don't like their rubbish 'cap' plans that charge you ridiculous rates when you go over.   Also I got a HTC Desire HD for which they could never fix the GPS and get it to work for the entire contact.In store service was alway friendly and helpful.Rip off rates when you exceed 'cap',1
An Antiquated Question,"I recently signed a 24 month SIM only mobile phone contract with Vodafone.  I brought my own phone and mobile number with me.  One of the questions the delightful and helpful young lady at Allphones was apparently required to ask me was ""Are you married?"".  I was of the impression that this kind of question went out with the ark.  It should certainly be irrelevant these days.  My credit rating had been checked and IDs supplied - surely that is all businesses require these days.  The customer service representative did seem to be slightly embarrassed at needing to ask this question.  If we had not already progressed so far down the track with the process I definitely would have walked out of that shop and researched another provider.  I have written to Vodafone in no uncertain terms registering my disgust.  It will be interesting to see if I get a satisfactory reply.  They certainly need to review their requirements for contract.  Incidentally, I am a 65 year old woman in possession of all my faculties!
A worthwhile plan if all goes according to Vodafone's promises and they provide good customer aftercare.
See my review above.",3
"No customer service , they only ask for your money","I called to ask for help with a faulty handset , they transferred the call to financial department and they ask me to pay a bill over the phone, the bill was paid already, they didn't listen and did not fix the issue. The retention department is a joke, never an apology from them.",1
"Bad service, wrong phone and terribl customer service","I hate i hate i hate vodafone,They are useless and 99.9 % of the time you cant understand!Its so frustrating.I had 400$ charged on my account when it wasnt supposed to be.They then say oh, we will look into it and get back to youThey didnt.I called back and then they say its been taken off. Clearly trying to just add on a few more dollars.
Thankyou for ruining my weekend! You suck and i hate you.

Wrong phone sent out after not having one for 5 days.",1
Dupe you into buying a datpak when all data used,Never had a problem with reception or Coverage. After using all the data allowance they send you a message saying you can buy a data pak which leads you to believe it will cover the excess usage. After receiving the bill you are charged for the datapak(unused as purchased on last day) and the excess megabytes. The call centre informed me that I had purchased the datapak after using the data so it wasnt covered. They would not even reverse the datapak which I got not use out of.Reception and coverage good. Call back when contacting customer serviceExpensive call and data rates when compared to smaller competitors,2
Customer service is completely rubbish!!!,"I had a issue to complain about the excess of data uses. I was using vodafone data about 40mb in an average. But I bought a data booster pack of 1.25gb for only 3 days because I didn't like to get high bill for the month. However vodafone calculated that i had used of approximately 2gb within 12min. After I have seen that surprised in my account I made a call over the customer team and they told me to wait for 3days to get the right details of uses. I wait for 3days and one of their representative told me that credit have been applied to my account but later I wanted to reconform that whether it is applied or not because same types of issue did happen to me before. In this time too another rep said it hasn't been applied!!!!
Different people different deal!!!! I suggest to everyone for not to go to Vodafone if you can!!! If you need to go for them definitely not for contract!!! You will be a pigeon in a cage if you go for contract!!!!
If you really want to go to Vodafone, just go for prepaid!!!

Terrible customer service!!",1

Dodgy phone upgrade procedure,"What ever you do don't upgrade your phone over the phone. Make the effort to go to a store. They will tell you your phone will arrive in 2 days but the last 3 times I have done this my phone has gone missing. Randoms signing off the package. They will not admit fault even though Australia post can tell you they have inputted the wrong address. The deal was based on the fact I would have the phone in 2-3 days and now are refusing to allow me to leave the contract based on the fact they did not live up to the terms of the deal. They won't even let me go down to my local store to pick up another phone! Told me to go onto Google to find a number to complain to even through the people I was talking to was from Customer relations but ""apparently"" the are a 3rd party company hired by Vodafone. End result i'm still fighting to get out of my contract while paying for a phone that I don't have.

A loyal customer who has been with them for many years and also working for them to be treated like this. Deal terms was not met and will not allow me to go down the the local store to pick it up.",1
Illegally withdraws money from bank accounts,"I used this service temporary until an adsl connection could be established, the speeds were ok and reliable connection was constant but the company itself is totally offensive and deceptive.the future, upon cancellation I also only used approx 7.5gb of the 8. Now their company rep confirmed that there was no additional charges or bills in the future, 2wks after cancellation vodafone sends me an invoice for an additional 22-23 dollars and upon this invoice I rang up and disputed it.

Now since desputing it, 2 wks after in July 2014 they access my bank accounts and withdrew the money, even though they had no longer any legal rights to access my bank account. What is even worse is they have came up with two completely different reasons to validate their own acts within only their own minds to being rightful in withdrawing money out of my bank account.

1st reason they gave in march when I rang them and disputed the invoice they gave -"" you havent been with us a month so we have refunded you 7 days and decided too charge you on a daily consumption usage and due too you leaving prior too 1 month you exceeded your daily allowance ""

",1
Illegally withdraws money from bank accounts,"Update - the TIO GOT VODAFONE to refund the money, apparently on the grounds that vodafone failed too send notifications. The weird part of this is vodafone specified my email too be at yahoo and I dont use yahoo at all, also at the time I disconnected I was actually under 8gb.
What was also specified was that once I was no longer Vodafone's customer on the 4 march, they were required to delete my banking details but 28 days later they withdrew the money from my bank account - what was specified about deleting my bank account details was obligated by privacy acts so literally they had no legal rights to withdraw money on the 2nd April",1
Freedom At Last,"In 4 days time my contract with Vodafone expires. cant waitI have been with the 3 network and Vodafone for approx 15 years. I migrated to vodafone when they took over 3Just prior to the change over I bought an HTC desire HD only to be tod by Vodafone that it was not suitable for their network.After much harassing by me the offered me a deal on a new HTC one X a great phone but once again I was unable to get decent coverage and data in the Gold coast area.After a great deal of complaining I was advised that that phone was unsuitable for their new network, seems to me they wanted to unload their old stock.Not good enough",1
Worst internet ever. Would not recommend even to my enemies,"My house doesn't have a phone line, so we use Vodafone's 3g as our only source of internet. This internet connection makes me miss dial-up. With speeds which I'm sure are at times even worse than dial-up, and a connection that drops out all the time, using Vodafone's 3g is an exercise in frustration and anger management. Don't be tempted by their cheap data rates, Vodafone's 3g is the devil, and I would not recommend it to anyone. I end up not being able to use most of my data just because there's no connection so much of the time.",1
Repaire,"My phone was playing up with 6 mths left on the contract. I went to the store they agreed it was faulty offered me a loan phone acknowledged it was covered under warrantee and said it would take about a fourtnight to repair. less than a week later I got a text saying my phone was ready. When I got to the store I was told it was un-repairable and here is your new phone. 10/10 Vodaphone.Vodaphone cop a lot of flack, I have been with 3 & Vodaphone for 8 years and never had a problem with them.",5
The worst possible network!,"Avoid this network at all costs. Coverage is frustratingly poor. Not worth it at all, will never ever ever use Vodafone again in my life. Was looking forward to starting fresh with a new network since moving here & for some reason I think I made the worst decision. Horrible",1
"False advertising regarding ""add-on"" data","In February 2014 I added $10 worth of extra data for the month whilst we were going on holidays to be able to check emails etc whilst away. I was assured by Vodafone that I could cancel the ""data add-on"" after that month's billing period which I tried to do 3 times online without success. I checked my online account in March to find that the add-on was continued ($10/month extra data) which I did not want. I phoned them a total of 3 times in March as it hadn't been cancelled, so I decided to use the data and pay the extra $10 whilst being assured by the service people (India) that it would be cancelled for the April billing period (from 7/4/14) . I checked online today (8/4/14) to find that it had not been cancelled and I was now going to incur another month's extra data cost. I rang 3 times today - once to the local Vodafone store who reported that it had been cancelled, but they couldn't credit me with this month's fees, so I called twice to India and was assured it would be cancelled for next month but I would have to pay another month's data fee. I complained and they have credited me with the $10 fee but as yet have not cancelled the add-on. I don't know if other people are having the same issues but I believe Vodafone is fraudulent in their advertising regarding the ""simple"" process of cancelling add-on data/calls. Please be aware and check your on-line account. I am seriously looking at another provider now even though to date I have had no real problems with Vodafone. Very disappointed with them!",1
Customer Service at it's best!!,"I was moving to rural australia where vodafone has no coverage. They were extremely reasonable and helped me find the best solution! They did it without me having to argue my case. All i had to do was tell them my problem and they immediately worked out how they could best serve me. And i got to keep my phone/ number in the bargain! One very satisfied customer. Thank you, vodafone.Understanding, reliable, inexpensive and efficient.No coverage in rural Australia",5
Bought $30 plan phone over the over,I have always have good experience with Vodafone when buying my mobile phone plan over the phone for over numbers of years because I alway got connected to sales person in Australia but for some reason now the sales person is now in India who would con and lie to me regarding an upgrade to my mobile but in the actual fact I got what a normal person got when they walk in the store please do not buy any mobile phone plan over the phone with the sales person in India they will only con and lie to you to get you into the contract as I have now done and now have to be with them for two years before my contract is run out.,1
No phone service,no phone service all over nsw so I stopped paying the bill called several timesno explanation for the lack of serviceVodafone then cut the little reception that they had provided ..... but still chargedthe monthly billhad two phones with Vodafone have since changed to a more reliableservice providerworking with high volume of the public I will not be recomendingVodafone or their serviceyou would do well to not have the misfortune of dealing with this  company,1
Mobile coverage,very unreliable coverage... I could be standing next to my partner who also has vodafone and network is not available!!!  This has been happening for well over 12 months and Vodafone only apologise despite our financial losses at not being able to contact clients or staff on the road.  To make matters worst... we are paying for coverage!!!  So how about Vodafone compensate all these people???,1
Worst service provider in Australia,"They are by far the worst service provider in Australia. Most of the time, there won't be network and if you want to call customer care, at least 30 min waiting is guaranteed. Also they never try to solve your problem, instead give bad suggestions to get more money from your pocket.",1
Appalling Customer Service!,"I had an account with Vodafone for 20+ years in this time they couldn't do enough to help, calling me to offer all sorts of deals, etc. Last year we relocated to Singapore and I wanted to keep my Vodafone account as I will be travelling back to Sydney every 2-3 months for a few weeks. I contacted Vodafone to ask them if I could divert my Australian mobile number to my Singapore mobile, so that when my parents rang me in Singapore they wouldn't be charged for an International call. I was assured this was possible. I was advised by customer service to go onto a $10.00 per month plan, as this would keep my number and it was the best plan, since I was going to be living in Singapore. When we arrived in Singapore the diversion didn't work!! 

After numerous phone calls to Vodafone Australia, calling from Singapore, I was put on hold and transferred numerous times, which is so frustrating, I was told that the diversion was not possible and I was told the wrong information. I wrote to Customer service, as I was appalled with the phone service that I received and after 2 weeks finally had a reply, saying I was told the wrong information. I wrote back asking them for a solution, as my Dad was in intensive care and that my family needed to contact me if there was an urgent situation (at this time we had no home phone in Singapore). I never heard back from Vodafone!
In December 2013 we went to Sydney for 2 weeks, and I received an account for around $500!! So much for the $10.00 plan, bring a good plan to be on. Numerous phone calls to Vodafone again, spoke to Supervisors, no service again!! They couldn't care less, offered nothing to assist.

Back in Singapore, went to Customer service at Sydney International Airport, after an overnight flight to ask them to change my account to pre paid and that I wanted to keep my number. The staff were nice, but it took 1 hour, the Customer service assistant at the counter, the Supervisor at the counter and them talking to a Customer service representative on the phone to sort out! Having my 4 year old daughter with me and had just flown in to Sydney I was not impressed that it took that long. I advised them of the bad service I had received from Vodafone and asked them to make sure that they got this right!
Well as you would of probably guessed, they didn't!! Rang Customer service, on

The phone for an hour again, transferred to a Supervisor nothing they could do with the $50 pre paid service that I bought as it was keyed in as a $50 365 day credit, so therefore instead of getting $1000 worth of talk time  and free text I received credit that ran out in one day! Nothing they could do about it!!

So that's it....goodbye Vodafone!! I wrote this post as I am over Vodafone upsetting me everytime I have dealt with them, it's not worth it! They have no idea on how to treat customers as they simply don't care, so don't waste your time with Vodafone!",1
So far so good but I wish their 4G had better coverage,"I got the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 with Vodafone with double data. So far I've had no real complaints. I have experienced the occasional dropout though. Their 4G is excellent....when I go into the coverage area that is. When I do a speed test I get over 100mb/s but I wish the coverage was better. I get only 1 bar of 4G where I am but need to be out of the house to receive it. I just hope Vodafone keeps improving their network and puts 4G in my area soon. Would be really great.Ultra Fast 4G, Cheap and seem to be continuously improving.4G coverage could be better.",3
Rip off,"Vodafone Au is the worst.All they care about is extracting as much money as from you as possible.Their agents will hide stuff from you on purpose so that afterwards they can get more money from you. They will only answer what you ask them. Managers aren't much better, there is no reasoning with them.Have lived in NZ for 10 years using vodafone for the same amount of time. Not a single problem. Never overcharged or shocked with additional hidden charges.",1
Sub standard,"Vodafone provide a substandard service at best. They were horrendous but are now just terrible. Their data speeds were unusable. Their customer service is bad. Improved but still bad. I have spent countless wasted hours arguing and dealing with their disasters. Let me share one that followed me like the plague. A couple of years ago or so I went on a plan for a Galaxy s2 and had to get it replaced twice. All of a sudden I get a text saying thanks for you upgrade to an iphone 4s. Then later, because you upgraded  we will charge you extra for the deal. Thing is I never had an iphone as I just got the S2. After hours on the phone it turns out it was someone elseâ€™s phone and some dealer made the error in another state.

So, I get the charge on my bill. I call up and argue, quoting the reference number form the original nightmare call where I was promised its resolution. The person who really canâ€™t speak great English argues that I did indeed have the iphone. I nearly burst a heart valve and go in to coronary arrest but finally they relent. This issue came back several times and eventually when I left this service after the 2 year contract. (Thank goodness). They promise but simply cannot deliver. Their systems, network and infrastructure are so bad it almost beyond fixing.",1
"Terrible is not worthy... Everyone should be aware that this network is beyond terrible, its shockin","What ever you do, dont sign up with vodafone, they sign me up on there $80 plan a month, i end up moving 2 months down the track to a small town where there is no network coverage. they gave me $20 credit a month for only one year, then charge me the $80 again. after spending 1 hr and 30 mins, (only this time) there exact words were ""we dont give credits anymore"" aaammm... sorry, not good enough. been paying you thousands for a useless phone and i only have 4 month before the contract expires. so Dont be satisfied with any excuses, ive asked to speak to a higher manager and after speaking with 5 people, they gave me a one off $25 credit, with a promise that if the network dosent work next month, i will get another credit.",1
Never again,"I was a three customer for many years, very happy with the quality of service, signal strength etc etc.  After the merge it all went down hill.  Signal strength is pathetic on my iphone 5.  Quite often i can't even send a text.   Charges for internet data are ludicrous.  Argued with them for two months over excess data.  They disconnected two phones after i politely refused to pay.  One of my phones used 1.5gig in 7 hours while at work.  This phone is not used during working hours and was confirmed by employer, but apparently a site that was being frequented was consistently running and chewing up my data un known to me.   Text messages regarding data usage were never received either.  

It was implied that i was lying about not receiving them.  Was advised to do certain steps to minimize this which were done while on the phone with customer support. Well bugger me if data wasn't chewed through even faster.  This phone was then accidentally dropped into a pool and stopped working.  When i asked what could be done i was basically told to suck it up!  Contract would still have to be paid out or early termination fees would be charged.  So after having 4 different phones with them over a 7 or 8 ur period i now have a 3000 dollar vodafone bill after they cancelled the contract on both phones.  Thanks for [censored word removed] all vodafone.

Signal, service, internet data usuage costs.",1
Beware,"I would like to share my story so all of you people to be cautious and beware of Vodafone dis-honoring their promises and u-turning from their commitments.  I have been a long time 3 and Vodafone customer and even with all the pain I have gone through because of Vodafone's poor service I have persisted with them. Anyways I wanted to re-sign for a new contract and get a new phone. Last week I called their upgrades department and spoke to [Personal Name Removed] and told him I wanted to stay on the same $29 plan but get a new phone (Iphone 5s). He told me that payment for the Iphone 5s was $20 per month on my existing plan. I asked him for a discount since I was a long time customer and he offered me $4 discount which made the total monthly payment to $45. He told me to go to a Vodafone store and call us from there so they can tell the store of this offer. I asked him to leave the notes on my account as well.
Anyways my wife went into the store but store was not aware of any such offer so I called them again. This time I met a new person. she told me since we have made an offer to you we are going to commit to that. I stressed again and again that I wanted to stay on the same $29 plan. She said she will call my wife (who was in the store). So she did and told her a new story that the offer of handset payment of $16 they made was on $40 plan and not $29 plan which was not what they had offered me. So my wife rang me and I was onto the phone again to Vodafone. 

This time I met another person (I don't remember the name). He told me that today the phone prices have gone up and now the Iphone 5s was $28 and maximum discount they can offer me was $3 on my existing plan. I asked him refer to my previous conversations with [Personal Names Removed] and they offered me $4 discount. He said that was the maximum he could do so I asked him to put me through to his supervisor. After very long wait I was put onto the Supervisor but he also said the same thing that they cannot offer me $4 but only $3. I said it was not about a dollar but matter of principle and they should stick to their promises. But he said that I should consider myself lucky to even get this offer. I got really upset and hung up the phone.

After cooling down and in real need of a phone, I went into Vodafone store again and the lady said there were no notes of even $3 discount. I called Vodafone again from the Store and this time it was a completely new story. Manufactures have increased the phone prices. Iphone 5s is $28 now and I have to pay $25 only after the $3 discount. I told this guy about their offer of $3 discount which made the payment to $17 but to no avail. After arguing for long time I asked him to put me through to supervisor. There was a long wait again. Supervisor repeated the same thing that he was not able to do anything and cannot offer the same price which was offered two days ago. I threatened to go elsewhere and that I have been a long time customer but he said its your own choice but we cannot honour the promises we made previously.I asked him how can I escalate this issue and he said I am the last point of contact and the next point will be Consumer Affairs.

At the moment I am really really frustrated and saddened for being treated like this. I just want you all to be aware of Vodafone and its false promises and especially their customer service is really really poor. I am now thinking about going to Consumer Affairs and complain. It may not go anywhere but at least I would have vented out my frustration.

False Promises!Poor Customer Service",1
Rubbish service and coverage,"Avoid this company at all cost, the costs are high and the coverage is terrible. On one trip to NZ they tried to charge $500 for data usage equivalent to half a photo. Then when pressed, they dropped it to $250 which is still too high. While their call centre isn't is bad as Indian based Telstra, they come a close second",1
Infurtiating,"I don't think it is possible to give worse service than this company except for when you are buying a plan of course - funny how they can get it right then.  I think they must have an office competition running in India to see who can make up the most lies in one day as the excuses I have received are ludicrous and contradictory. In the last 12 months, they have overcharged by HUGE amounts and I've had to go to Ombudsman to get a credit, they've taken money off my credit card without authority (I manually pay my account online) then made it really hard to get a refund and now making it difficult to change providers as they have incorrect date of birth for one of our numbers in their system even though our other 4 numbers are correct and all are in the same name.  They've obviously made a typo but now I have to go into a store to get it resolved.  Lately, after waiting 10 minutes to speak to someone, they ""cannot hear me"" when I ring them and hang up on me.  Could this have something to do with the fact I am entering a number into their system that has been switched to another provider? The voice recognition system hears me just fine!  I cannot wait to be rid of them.  Hoping today will be the day but you never know..... it feels like Groundhog Day.
Cheap
Nasty",1
Unbelievable incompetence,"We have some of our work mobiles with vodafone.  I have been trying to get a copy of an invoice for 2 months. They have sent a reminder notice but we still don't have the bill.  Actually - i did receive a bill by email; but the file had a password,  which was apparently my pin number, but that didnt' open it.  So i wrote back and no-one replied.. (but i got the other email with the locked file?)  so she would send me a verification email to reply to.  Well... That hasn't arrived either.      I attempted to register on their website but couldn't get anything to function there either.   

Today i called optus today, and whilst i went through several people before i got to someone who could help,  i got a copy invoice emailed within 10 minutes.    

I am totally at my wits end trying to get a copy of the bill they want us to pay from vodafone.  My wits end people.  Its been months.

Appalling incompetence.  How does this company stay in business?",1
Worst service ever,"Terrible customer service, and coverage is absolutely pathetic. Had problems getting internet in Darling Harbour, in the centre of Sydney.  In Wollongong black spots are everywhere.  Couldn't reliably get a connection at central station to lookup train timetables. Calls randomly dropped or could not be placed.  Would not recommend them to anyone.",1
Worse customer service experience,"I would have given them 0 star if possible, if you lodge complaint or reply back to their emails every time different person will contact you as if they are scared to speak with customer and even their supervisor was not aware of their policies and want me to call him back instead of offering call back so he can check with his supervisor.Customer service is bunch of liars...........",1
Very very very bad customers service,It's the worst customer service that anyone can ever get! None of them is willing to help as they are memorizing the rules and not understanding which is very annoying as they can't solve any serious problem!! Terrible coverage for the network!!!!!!!!!!!!And always data finishes quickly even without using which doesn't make sense at all.,1
There is NO comparison!!,"I was on the 365 day $365 prepaid unlimited calls SMS & 5 g monthly data allowance with Red Bull.Fantastic! Yes there was issue with often having to do 2 phone calls instead of  1 because of dropouts but I was so happy with their Aus call help line and mobile data allowance  I could put up with dropouts.Absolute tragedy it all had to end.Have spent hours using my sons cable internet to find another great deal like I had.Can't find one.Anyone got a brainstorm?I would be most grateful to hear.Inexpensive, Aus phone help line, 5 g monthly dataDropouts",4
"Budget contracts are their ways to get more money from you, beware!","I took a $29.00 postpaid phone contracts with them, i thought it is a smart way to save in telephone expenses...End up with a bill with 4 times of my contract value just because i used 400 MB extra data usage just 400 MB extra data, they charged me $80.00 more than my contract of $29.00. So don't just simply sign contract, check how much expensive they charge with extra data....",1
Poor customer service,"After five and a half years of being a loyal customer of Vodafone my recent experience of exceptionally tedious and poor customer service and exceptionally bad coverage has made me despair and decide it is time to get rid of Vodafone. I spent nearly 2 hours on the phone trying to find out why my prepaid credit of $100 within 2 days and only one local phone call and one text message after I recharged with another $50 had vanished amd I received text messages of insufficient funds. All I got was an explanation of ""upgrades"" being the reason for no cstomer service then on the 3rd day talking to a supervisor for over an hour and getting standard expressions that were very frustrating assisted my decision. Good riddance Vodafone if you treat customers that badly you will lose more than you recruit.

Extremely bad customer service (Beware of Vodafone)",1
Fast Vodafone has improved,Cheap plans beats all other competitors $65 a month samsung s4 4g plan 3gb internet unlimted calls to vodafone mobile and sms to overseas fast internet so far good :) I recommend every one get vodafone much beater then optus I had 1 bar signal in acaica ridge and sunnybank I have full bars now with vodafonefast internet good deal,5
So much for 3G,"Unfortunately locked into a 2 year contract with Vodaphone and just counting the days down until I can move to another provider. A promised 3G network which I rarely find myself on despite working, commuting and living in Sydney so maybe the key is to live somewhere remote. See them advertising 4G which just makes me laugh, then cry......",1
I absolutely regret using Vodafone -,"Who is willing to pay $355 for 3.5 GB data ?Call the call centre and wait for the fun to begin....""Our system is running slow ""...""Sorry we cant help you as we cannot access your account right now to determine what the charges are for your contract ""Has anyone ever taken legal action against them?Its about time they got removed as a Service Provider... they are  beyond useless and continue robbing the public without remorse and without sanction from the Telecom authorities.",1
Avoid like the plague.,Everyyhing about vodafone is terrible.The web site never works so you have to call all the time.And make sure you have time as you will spend hours on hold.Internet connection if you can get it is ok but way way over priced.My only advice for anyone reading this is there is way better out there so dont waste your money with vodafone.,1
Shocking service,"I have been with vodafone more than 4 years but i had trouble every time when i upgrade my plan. first time i got INQ handset which battery goes flat after 10 minutes but they did not replace and it was still under warranty . second handset i got HTC hd which was really bad it hanged up i took it to vodafone service centre they could not fix it the problems i been there 10 times waste my time & money that handset also under warranty. Now third time i upgrade my plan & know what they did sent me another new mobile number which was really upsetting, i paid for both plans untill my old plan finished which remained 4 months.i had billing problem they changed my plan without telling me . will not signup again & would not reckon to anyone

bad warranty service , expensive , billing problems",1
Billing erros,"I was offered $ 60 pan + $ 9 device payment but they are charging $ 70 all up instead of charging $ 9 theycharging $ 10 , Be careful about the mobile plans and initially offered me $ 50 credit but I never get it , service was very bad , after this contact I will never stay with them",1
Why bother?,I dont even know what to say waste of time reception drops out internet is always slow as an old goat when you ring same guy doing his talk produce looping around the world i had them call me back to assist which they ended up getting nowhere as usual so i hung up a one stage last year in nov i would walk outside and i had no bars.,1
Pure rubbish,"Vodafone,i have had so many issues with you this year and your continual appalling services have made me lost all respect for your company. First off, i'd like to note that the first issue was early this year when i handed in the phone for repairs. Not only did it come back still broken once, but twice. One month without my phone because you were unable to repair it even though you claimed you did and i was still paying for your services. So, i received a new phone since it was sent back three times for repairs. I asked the operator if i had to return the old handset, he said 'no'. After a month, i receive a text claiming that i was charged $459 for not returning the old handset. Not only was i given false information, now i'm being charged for your fault? This was back in june/july. It's so far back that i can't even remember the exact month. So i returned the old handset to the highpoint, vic vodafone store in july. It is now nearing december and it the outstanding $459 still has not been cleared. You do not know how much time and money i have wasted because of you. I have called your customer care more than 10 times in order to get this rectified, each call with a duration of an hour or more. My call has been transferred countless times, my services cut 3 times (so i had to call to reconnect my services and explain over and over again about my situation), before being told to just wait. Simply, wait? I have been waiting for months and i am sick and tired of your atrocious services. I have visited the store numerous times to get my phone fixed (as explained above) and to rectify this billing issue, which they couldn't do anything since the factory hasn't received it. Have i received compensation? No.
I will be taking this to the accc and tio if this continues and if i receive nothing in compensation. I am definitely terminating my contract at the end of this month and i want this issue solved before termination. I used to respect you. If you want to keep your customers, maybe you should follow-up with them and fix their issues instead of robbing them and leaving them in the dark with only a bill of $459.",1
"Phone service awful, personal service great","The phone service is a nightmare of long periods on hold, getting cut off, and talking to computers instead of human beings. The personal service is great - the young people are knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. May I particularly recomment Ammar at 259 Sydney Road, Brunswick East, Victoria, Australia.The personal service at their sales centresThe telephone service - computerised, lengthy waits, getting cut off",3
Poor Customer Service,"Don't try & call Vodafone Customer Serice as you will be put on hold & passed around until finally they hang up! After 35 minutes of listening to an automated women telling me  that someone will attend my call shortly, only to be cut off! Having called back & waited a further 16 minutes to be told someone will call me back. No one did call but today I get a text message to rate their callback system??? They never called me! So how could I rate their callback service! All I wanted was a breakdown in our wifi data as I cannot understand for the past 3 months we are using 12gb in 4 days? Whereas 3 mobile would last a month with only 6gb?",1
Never again,"We have been with Vodafail with our company for over ten years. But finally they forced me to swap to another provider just by their bad network coverage. Even if they promised the new Vodafone nothing happened. And we are in Sydney Metro. It was not an easy decision as we had quite a few numbers with them.o get a copy of the invoices. Unfortunately one number was not linked to direct debit, so there was an outstanding amount of approx 100$.

Vodafone engaged their debit collectors within 30 days without contacting us at all.  The debt collectors called us on the 18.10.2013 and I asked for a copy of the outstanding invoice which was mailed to me. I received that invoice on the 29.10.2013 and paid it the same day. In between Vodafone already reported the payment failure to VIDA. Without giving me the chance to see the invoice at all.

So I talked to Vodafone today and asked them, to remove the VIDAS entry. They refused for no reason.

Unbelievable after we spend a 1000$ a month with them for over ten years...

Worlds worst service, overpriced, call centers in Philippines with bad english",1
worst Telco ever,No reception and received no discount took to tio only resolution was$300 for a faulty Sony Xperia sAnd $750 for remainder of contract moved to virgin and more happyI'm now on plan again and Alot more happier also VODAFAILdon't care about customers only milking Australia of its money.No customer loyaltycheapuseless bunch of people no customer service,1
Vodafone is a real sucker!!!,"You would be in deep [censored word removed] if you ever been lured into VODAFONE. We were misled into a business account and the bill for the first month was more than $180. Then another Indian Vodafone customer service guy offered a ""brilliant"" deal when our 2 years contract finished. However it turned out to be a nightmare. You should record every word you say and the name of the people you are dealing with everytime otherwise you will be screwed for something you don't even know. Sooooooooooooo sick of it.  DO NOT EVER EVER buy phones from VODAFONE!!!",1
Customer Service,I was for years with Optus and switched to Vodafone because they had a phone i wanted.  I got a phone everything was perfect. But after some problems started i realised why so many people left Vodafone. Customer service deserves zero. I rang numerous times and i was shocked how people working with customers are uninterested to help you and uninterested in doing their job the way they are paid to do it. Even workers at the Vodafone store ignored me. Lucky for me  [name removed] was different. After a few months of not knowing what to do. he helped me to finally solve my problem in the best interests of me. I hope Vodafone managers will realise how good a worker  [name removed] is and praise him for his efforts and abilities.Gordana,3
Absolute rubbish,Switched my phone from Vodafone over the Telstra when my contract was up.  Their network is terribly slow and you'll save yourself a lot of time and hassle if you just start with one of the big networks to begin with.   Don't waste your time with Vodafone - the sooner they fail the better.,1
"Terrible coverage, excess charges every month and terrible customer service from india",Vodafone in general is a terrible service. connectivity issues and overcharged with data every month. never exceeded data when under crazy johns ever since the official changeover to the voda brand i have been overcharged every month. may as well go with a premium telecommunications provider because right now im paying $300 a month in excess charges. dont even get me started on the hours ive spent on the phone to their outsourced india call centres.... absolutely horrible experience,1
Avoid Vodaphone,"I have  basically a spare phone on a boat which gives alternate coverage dependng on which area I am in. A couple of years ago I took a prepaid card from Vodaphone because it was convenient and had to put $50 credit on it. On two occasions they have simply cancelled the number and taken away the credit because I did not recharge it by a due date. I have then had to deal with the most rude and condescending people that I have ever met saying things like ""well I am warning you that I am going to only do this once and suggest you read the conditions"" etc etc. I just need some dribbling barely 20 year old in an overseas  call centre  to be giving me warnings - not. They have done it again and told me that I would have to pay them a fee to reinstate the number and get my credit back!!! Cutting my losses - never again. Absolutely no idea of customer service - avoid Vodaphone like the plague.

Worst customer service of any Telco",1
Liars!!,"I absolutely can not stand vodafone. I am at my witts end with their customer service team! After not being satisfied with my plan, i was made an offer to change and add more data on a year contract (which I did). After speaking to vodafone the time after this deal was made, I was told about a deal that suited my needs way better, but i was never told about this deal in the first place! i asked to cancel the data contract and move to this better plan. In response I was told that the computer can not do this and nothing can be done unless i paid the $100 cancellation fee! That is ridiculous! Humans control computers, not the other way round! I am over the way they talk around what they really mean. I have been with vodafone from the beginning and after all the problems I have had, I am done with them!

Their customer service team are one of the worst I have ever dealt with.",1
"apauling reception, value and staff!!!!!!!","absolutely appauling service by vodafone here, i was with optus paying $65 a month and not once went over my bill, i changed to vodafone to get an iphone 5 and got more data more calls and still unlimited text, i also got a home phone and adsl2+ about a week after i joined vodafone so all my 2 hr conversations and high data usage times were at home on wifi or used the home phone, and every month without fail i went over my bill, i never had reception to make a call for more than 2 minuttes or even load google so all i done was text and they told me that was unlimited so there is no way i could have went over, i now have half the data and half the calls on my dodo mobile and never even use half of that, when i really needed to make a call i couldnt as i had no network, it took me months to get them to agree to letting me out of the contract that they were not abiding by, by far the worst phone company out..... i still believe i was paying about $70 a month to much for that phone (bill was usually about $150 a month) i am now with dodo and love having a unlimited home phone unlimited internet and two mobiles that only cost $150 a month....... never go vodafail they are a massive disgrace, i believe i never went over the bill but they told me i did, i know for a fact i did not, they just told me i was
phone made a good paper weight
poor customer service, poor reception, lying to me about going over my bill, EVERYTHING!!!!!!",1
Horrible experiance,"I was with Vodafone for two years, upon updating my contract and moving towns I discovered I had no reception.. When I called the Vodafone department and explained what was going on they were extremely unhelpful land took months of my time fighting with them. Now while I am trying to apply for my first home I discover they still haven't sorted out my account even though they informed me it was done 12 months ago. Called them again and they said my account was clear but they haven't let there credits department know. I now have to wait for them to do this and there is a high chance I will miss my settlement date. They are rude and unhelpful my needs are not important to them at all, they have waisted my time, efforts and possibly my future.  I will never again go through Vodafone and will warn anyone against them.

No communication, horrible service, horrible staff disgrace of a company.",1
Waste of space ..worst telco ever,"Have been with vodafail for 10 years now and can't stand it anymore...severe lack of reception outside metro areas...vodafail tell me that reception at my home address is great...and it is , but since it's a mobile phone , I require my service to work at other locations than home!SMS takes days sometimes to go through...this has been an ongoing issue with vodafail .As soon as I get the result from TIO, I'm out of vodafailProbably get better reception using 2 tin cans and a piece of string",1
Contract almost over,"Well i went from Three mobile to Vodafail...... Unfortunately.My contract of 2 years expires next month and i am out of there.Go anywhere out of a metro area and you struggle to find reception. Go rural and you have NO chance at all.They are by far the words telecommunication company in Australia and only blame the 'perception' that Vodafail has no reception, but let me tell you... They dont.I will admit ive gone from 1 bar to 3 bars in certain suburbs but its just not good enough.Im switching to iinet mobile shortly.",1
Horrible customer service,My contract finished last month and I placed an order for a Galaxy S4 this morning.But 4 hours later I decided I would rather have a note 2 but they said there is no change of mind policy and no cancellation policy.They would not even look for alternate options and one of the rep even said you should have thought about it in the first place.How rude!! Will never recommend Vodafone to anyone.,1
Worst customer service,Vodafone has the worst customer care service .don't know whats the use of calling them i have got an extra usage of internet 300$ total bill was around 400$ i asked them i gonna pay bill in two instalments they have accepted the part time payments by the next the day they have direct debited the entire money 400$ worst part of vodafone australia .plz dont go for vodafone plan its like locking urself in an dark room for 24months .again i have spoken to customer service about this he aplogize he said u get money back at end of the day i dont got any money feeling very annoyed i never suggest my friends to take vodafoneVodafone there are very greedy of money .Bad customer service,1
Constantly bad reception.,"I have had vodaphone for 10 years and it has gotten to the point where i am writing a review. No fliexability in the area of price either. Never lock yourself in a room you cant get out of with a vodaphone plan or prepay mobile, because if you are in trouble you know for sure you wont be able to call for help.",1
No Reception,"I never have reception using Vodafone. Many important calls have gone straight to voice mail but I don't receive a text message saying so until hours later. They seem to take my husband's complaints seriously as he is on a plan, but my complaints aren't important as an inferior prepaid user. I am still waiting for their promised improved reception...",1
"vodafone, more like vodafail","Vodafone aka vodafail is an absolute joke. No reception, customer service pathetic, constant internet drop outs and the list goes on. No body in their right mind can see this company offering any value to customers. You are better off going with telstra or optus in my opinion, even though they are not perfect. But anything is better than vodafail. I'm glad i left this sinking ship a while ago. Vodafail will most likely suffer a slow and excruciating demise in Australian telecommunications, sooner rather than later.",1
Data Usage Trap,Exact same as previous review just happened to me.  Really annoyed don't have time for this rubbish.  Been with them on same plan for years and was never aware of any data usage limit or excess charges then stung for over $300 in a couple of days. Not happy with Vodafone.,1
Unbelievably poor service,I have 3 mobile phone numbers with vodafone and was with Three for 9 years prior to that. For one of the numbers there was extra data usage of 2.5GB and they charged us $590 extra. This is the first and only time that we used extra data in last 10 or so years and it was used unnoticed. After talking to the operator asking for discount since it was a result of mistake the answer is no. After staying a loyal customer and enduring poorest service for 10 years this is what I get paying extra $590 in one bill for a mistakenly used mere 2.5GB of data without any consideration. I am so disappointed and cannot wait until the end of contract.,1
Appauling,"I have on multiple occasions rung up Vodafone and waited out their long call waiting periods.I have been hung up on twice... and I am not rude in anyway.Months ago I explained I do not have the know how or a computer facility to update my operating system so requested they help me with notifying me when I am about to go over my $49 cap. They did not help what so ever. Most recently I was notified SIX days after I went over my data usage of 1 GB (i accidentally left Data Roaming on) so I went along for 6 days using data that I now have to pay another $150 for. On the phone they did nothing to assist me and still my phone is not set up to notify me when I am approaching my cap. Whats more I informed them my entire family including grandparents are on Vodfone as I set up all their phones. I told them if I am not refunded for that period of over usage that I will change all phones to another network. The supervisor I talked to admitted their company has the approach that they would prefer to not refund my $150 and lose out on over $5500 per year on my familys bills. 

Terrible service, terrible company, terrible business approach.

Service, expensive, delayed usage updating, bad customer service, poor reception.",1
Waste network,"I signed up with Red SIM $45 month to month plan (August 24 2013) . Include $700 credit (including international call) + unlimited SMS + 1.5GB mobile data.Sounds good!!

If you want a phone for nothingâ€¦.. go for Vodafone.",1
Dodgy service all round,"Bad reception, long wait times, shuffling around from one person to the next and dodgy tactics to keep you with them when you try to cancel your account ie trying to push you into buying more [censored word removed] and different plans (not that you can understand what plans they are offering to well because of the language barrier anyway) or they put you on hold for a very long time probably in the hopes you will hang up and and forget the whole thing. I do feel bad for the customer service operators in all of this its the people at the top that run the show so they need to sort it out, to busy penny pinching I suppose!",2
I Feel sorry to be a Customer of vodafone,"I'm stuck with my plan for 2 years , with bad reception and slow internet at all time and when i go out of Sydney there is no signal at all in some areas.and when i call overseas they connect me to a local number and i had to call again and again till i get my line connected . Customer service is worse as I need to talk to overseas companies (india) and most of the time non of the problems are solved- just typical solution like turn off your phone and back again - or even rest your handset .even though the problem is from there end.my plan finishes I will never go back to Vodafone again.
I have a bundle a Mobile Broadband for my Galaxy tab 2 that I gave to my brother,and witch I'm not using anymore I asked then many times If i can have a USB stick so I can use this service instead of paying the money for something that never use .

No reception ,poor customer service,paying for Broadband service that I barely uses",1
Terrible Internet Speed And Poor Network Coverage.,"Their network coverage is pathetic, and their Internet on an iPhone 5 is sooooo extremely painfully slow.ed for my Internet service on my iPhone. I started off with the $29 cap which gives 500 mbs for the month and that was sufficient. Never went over! I still had the same usage, then I was running out of that cap more and more as time progressed. So I decided to get the $49 cap which gives 3GBs data per month (it sounds like a lot, but it leaves by the time you blink). The first few months I had all this data remaining at the end of the month. Still the same usage, I wasn't even watching YouTube which eats GBs faster, I ran out 3 weeks into the month. Then the next time I get it I ran out 2 weeks into the month. They keep overcharging so then you can buy the higher and higher and higher cap. Not to mention that they've increased in prices from their cap being available from 30 days to 28 days. 

I'm so unbelievably ecstatic to be leaving this company as soon as my credit expires this month. I would never recommend this to a friend and am sharing my bad experience with everyone.

Terrible network connection. Abnormally slow Internet speed.",1
the worst network provider ever,"I'm using my internet always at home using my wifi connection, and suddenly at the end of month they send me text msg that I overused my cap. I have to pay 25, I'm not yoo sure then I check agaib my balancr they said I habe to pay 36 dollar within a minute.wth? So since then I talk to customer service theyre not good at all they speak a little english look like indian people. I couldnt understand so I will tell all my friend never use this service. Too many people told me that vodafone is rubbish.  But I still loyal. Now for nothing. So I will move to optus for sure. And tell all the people that I know never use this service. The internet is very slow even 4g.service, network service, customer servicebad bad bad quality",1
No detailed accounts / Community Forum run by dictators!,"Vf have duplicated my usage in the past (charged me double -  incorrectly).   They used to show 'detailed' accounts...  Now they don't, and (apparently) it is up to the customer(s)  to  (if they want details), to download the excel version, and  ""figure it out for themselves""!) on their community forum is censored!   Just about everything said   is    against their rules!

They say  'opinions'  (negative towards vf)  are 'disrespectful'  to other members!  

Huh?  What?   No they are not!   

",1
Do not use this company,"What is it about this company that they do not understand we have taken our business elsewhere. We signed up with telstra about 5 months ago now and cancelled vodafone. They are still helping themselves to our bank account. I put a block on it this month went back into the shop again. Guess what just went to email and found another bill today after being promised it was finally sorted, do not even bother ringing there customer service as they just hang up because they do not know what to do. Frustration in one word sums this mob up looks like we go back to shop again.",1
"A horrible company, will never do business with them ever again","Absolutely [censored word removed] poor network coverage just standing in one spot the signal can fluctuate from full bars to no bars without even moving in a matter of seconds. Many calls were just disconnected while I was talking which was extremely inconvenient. Call centre was horrible to deal with especially that [censored word removed] computer you have to tell what you want which can't even understand you. Then if you finally after waiting for an hour or so got through to someone they were either in India or the Philippines so you couldn't even understand them or the stupid computer sent you to the wrong ""department"" who couldn't deal with the issue. I got out of it middle of last year when a Vodafail called me to upgrade to new contract at which point I heavily criticised the BS of his company and was released from the contract. I wanted to give ZERO STARS above, but 1 is the minimum you must give for a review and is 1 too many.

no reception all the time, piss poor customer service, paying for something you can't even use",1
"Overcharged, mysterious bills, terrible coverage.","Was forced to switch from Three to Vodafone because I was still under contract a few months ago. Three's coverage had been crap ever since they moved to the Vodafone network. Upon changing, Vodafone gave me 50mb data for $50/month (ludicrously small), compared with Three's 1.5gb. So I ended up getting charged about $70 over the top on my first Vodafail bill.rcharge, my next bill was $0.05 + $10 overdue fee. Couldn't be bothered arguing with support so I just paid it off. All the while paying $60+/month with Vodafone. When that ended I cancelled my number, was badgered by a salesperson for about 30 minutes to renew, to the point of harassment, until he realised I was a lost cause. The best part about Vodafone was ending the contract.

Overall, their plans are crap, you always get overcharged, support are of no help, coverage is bad.
Ending the godforsaken contract
Terrible coverage, constantly overcharging, crappy data plans,  crappy customer service, disorganised, aggressive salespeople, asssssssssss.",1
Poor customer service,"Cant believe I'm saying this, but Three used to be much better than what Vodafone is! I was with Three for  six years, but as soon as Vodafone took over Three we began to get issues. Customer service doesnt seem to care, and their prices have gone up considerably.. so we are going to go with Aldi..",1
Suicidal,Suicidal is the place Vodafone will drag you to.,1
Didn't expect to get the kind of service i have received over the phone,"I had a prepaid mobile with Vodafone and then recently i upgraded to iphone 5 contract and i also have prepaid mobile broadband. I've been with them for a while, fortunately didnt have much contact/issueswhen i was on the prepaid mobile, however when i switched over to a plan for the first time things got interesting. For the first 3 bills i was see strange massive charges and an obvious data bug/glitch issue. where it was eating up my data in 2 days and i had next to no apps and did not use the internet on the iphone at that point in time. It was unfortunate that it took 3 bills for vodafone to realise something wasnt right  however in saying that each time i called, without even requesting they would write off these amounts and it would be around the $90-$100. They also gave me extra data. I didnt not expect this and it was very much appreciated. When i have had technical issues with the iphone 5 they go to great lengths to isolate the issue and make great effort to call me straight back after phone has reset to check all is in working order. 

With the prepid broadband on my laptop, if i have ever had issues trying to recharge, for e.g at one point it may have actually been my credit card declining the payment however i rang up the voda tech support they gave me temporary data until i resolved the issue with my bank. Again, very much appreciated!

However Instore is a bit different to getting help over the phone. I will admit instore is terrible and i have never received any real assistance. Actually i have had horrible problems instore which almost made me move all of my services elsewhere.

Just recently i was looking at maybe taking out a contract for mobile broadband, i rang the sales team he couldnt find a product for 12months but he suggested he would  look into it for me and call me back, to which he did and even though he was not able to find a product he was able to go through many other products within prepaid that might suit me better and where i could purchase if i didnt want to purchase it straight away (so in other words not just to make a sale). Again it was appreciated. Not a lot of companies call back when they say they will and i appreciate those that do.

The actual phone service/range itself from vodafone could be better , get quite a few drops outs, no service etc but its good that something is improving",4
Rip off: They will expoit you to squeeze out every cent they can,"If there is one person who reads the fine print, it's me. Yet, vodafone has consistently found away to bill me for things I never asked for. I was on Optus, but Optus wouldn't allow me get a phone on contract, so I switched to vodafone and got on their $60 plan for galaxy s4. They gave me two sim cards and told me I could use the other one on a tablet. I told the lady that I didn't have a tablet, but she persuaded me to take it saying if I took it I would get 2.5 gig free data on it for the first month and that I could cancel before that time if I was sure I wouldn't need it. So I took it and as you would have figured, I was billed $33 for it within 4 days. I called to complain and I was told there is no record of a free offer on their system so I had to pay. Then I got a bill that was far higher than my monthly plan (yes, I know in your first month on a plan you get billed more, because you are also charged for the time between when you signed up and when your monthly billing cycle begins). What I'm saying is that beyond that additional charge my bill was still excessive; I was billed for a 500 MB data add-on that I was never told of (Note: this is different from the 1.5gig data/month that they bill me for as part of my plan). 

They call this one an add-on that I cleary don't need, that I didn't ask for and that I was never told I would get and be billed for. And even logging into ""my vodafone"" online clearly indicates that I didn't exceed my regular 1.5g (I didn't even use it at all because i've got wifi), yet I was billed for an additional ""500MB add-on"". Another annoying thing is their deliberate attempt to make it difficult for you to understand your bill by showing you all the figures excluding GST. I understand why they should state the cost of the service that way, but next to every figure, they could at least tell you what the overall cost was, then one can easily understand the cost for each component and compare it with one's expectations. As it is now, I have a bill with over 40 items, each stated excluding GST, so to doublecheck the accuracy of each component I need to pick a calculator (only the total summary is shown with a GST). 

On top of that each bill is at least 4 pages (and that excludes your call details). That is four full pages of charges and numbers that only they would understand and they claim it's because they want you to have details of how you were charged. But anyone who has seen that statement knows that  it's the same items repeated over and over in different ways until nothing makes sense. I'm not saying they charge me multiple times for the same item; I'm just saying they present the same charge repeatedly in different ways and with details that makes it difficult for you to confront them because it's exceedingly difficult to follow. At the end of a bill they sent me, they had two different final figures that were far apart, leaving me with no idea of what to pay without calling customer service. And if you've ever called their customer service during the non-day period without being put on hold for 2 hours (no exaggeration) before being transferred to India, then I will really like to know how you got it done. And half the time you can't even get help online because the website is undergoing ""maintenance"" so that they can ""provide you with better service"".  This is the worst deal I've ever struck. I had only being with this guys for five days and I was already liable for twice the amount of my monthly plan.",1
Worst Service from a Big name!,Vodafone network service is the worst I have ever seen. Every single day I have problems in catching up vodafone network in parts of Sydney CBD/even in suburbs. Pathetic service. I really didnt not expect this from a telecom company in Australia......Service in other parts of world is really better than Vodafone Australia........Shame on you VFA!,1
Worst network in Australia,"Terrible Terrible network. While it is a cheap alternative to Telstra, the network coverage is terrible, even in the middle of a large city like Sydney and even worse in the suburbs. Customers are better of with paying more for Telstra or paying less with the likes of Kogan Mobile.Cheaper alternativeBad coverage.",1
Worst network in Australia,I guess that's your experience. Never had any issues with Telstra.,1
Worst network in Australia,"James, thanks for the reply. I suspect Vodafone's improvement is due to the rollout of their 4G network. I may give them another chance, since Kogan is no longer in the mobile industry",1
Vodafone,"i am curently one of the very many unsatisfied vodafone customers who frequently dose not get any service on my mobile phone this is continualy happening 3 to for times a day and lasting upto 2+ hours at a time where i cannot send or recieve messages or calls an where i cannot use so called mobile data i have spoken to the customer sevice team on numorouse occations to no avail i am also a member of a large corporation with many vodafone customers who have all signed a petition to bycott vodafone for all personal and business uses and to cancel there existing contracts so far there are 228 customers on the boycott list and growing every day, so i would like to know what sort of compensation is available to vodafone existing customers to try to keep us from going to another more reliable service provider?",1
Disgusting customer service,"Have been sending e-mails and calling for 2 weeks to try and unlock a phone.  Customer service is extremely poor, poor, non-existent.  Turnaround is too slow 2 days, and too many people handling the problem.  Still waiting for a response from a customer service staff who ""promised"" to call Wednesday 7/8/13 - Nothing so far.  Do not use this company.",1
The worst mobile broadband,"With 3 shutting down I made the big mistake of switching to Vodafone - figuring it was on the same network, so the service would be just as poor. Wrong - couldn't be any worse.1: the only way to connect to the internet is by booting up your computer - really.You are then taken to a web page with a connect / disconnect button on it, which enables you to access the internet - But the Disconnect button does not disconnect you - it only restricts your access.You can actually really disconnect by disabling your connection if you are technically savvy enough, but then the only way to re-connect is by re-booting your computer.
2: Really slow- poor connection - and when it drops - reboot again.
3: To make the connection even slower - they inject code into every webpage you request - the effect; you spend minute after minute looking at a blank web page and reading 'waiting for 1.2.3.4..."" on the browser status bar.

Tried ringing the service line - after going through the worst computer-voiced menu system, I was put on hold for 36, 22 and 17 minutes before it hung up on me - gave up after the third time.

Answers on the website - not a chance.

Vodafone shows GREAT Loyalty,Give this company a miss.  Been with them for several years and decided to get a phone unlocked and still charged $25.  I was thinking of renewing my mothers contract with them. But BYE BYE VODAFONE and hello Virgin.  One of the worst customer service companies I have dealt with.  My contract finished in JUNE and they are still sending me bills for the handset  !!!!!,1
All I can say is useless!,"I had been with 3 for quite some time and I thought they were bad enough, then Voda-fail bought them out. Vodafone has the worst customer service by far. They incorrectly put two billing accounts on the one account and then tried to charge us when we tried to consolidate the two billing accounts! Every step taken by Vodafone has been incorrect and just plain stupid. I cannot wait until my contract expires and I can go somewhere else! If you are thinking of going to Vodafone, I strongly suggest you think again. It will work out better in the end to pay slightly more somewhere else then to waste your time, fuel and money on this incompetent company!",1
Pure diarrhea.,"I am currently on the Samsung Galaxy S2 $30/month plan. After a year, the phone died (fair enough, it was my fault for charging it quite often) so I gave it in for it to be fixed under warranty. After 2 weeks, I received it, excellent!... not. Came back broken with a different issue - the handset's speaker didn't work. It worked before it died (I'm not sure about the term but it wouldn't turn on nor would it charge) so I'm guessing they did something wrong. Even if they didn't, they're still [censored word removed] because I sent it in again right after receiving it to get it fixed... another two weeks. After two weeks, received it back, excellent!... not. Wouldn't even recognise sim cards and the same issue was ongoing, that is, the speaker was still broken. I liked how the report they had said ""good condition"". So they asked me to get a refurbished one, I said ""No, you are [censored word removed], I'm giving them a call.""

Gave them a call, was on hold for 40 minutes (It's Vodafone, what do you expect from a [censored word removed] service?), was transferred and on hold for another 30 minutes, complained and they sent me a new phone. I asked if I needed to return the old handset, they said ""No"". Good, everything is good, excellent!... not. 

A month later, I get a text saying I was charged $459 for not returning the old handset. Like, What. The. [censored word removed]. Seriously? ""Oh, it was our fault, so we deeply apologise"" Well [censored word removed] you. They said they will send me a special envelope to return the old handset. They said it'll take 3-5 business days. It's been three weeks. I don't want to wait another hour to call them back just because of their own multiple mistakes.
I am definitely changing to another carrier once my contract ends, no hesitation whatsoever. I strongly recommend Vodafone to no one. It's a company full of lies, poor service and pure diarrhea.",1
Vodaphone  Worst  Customer Service ever!,"Vodaphone tried to convince me to change from the now defunct three to them.Was told by vodaphone to go to  a vodaphone shop which I did. However, I had to get my  phone unlocked from three, the shop didn't carry a spare SIM so I could unlock it there and changeover to Vodaphone.  One would think because they are the same company it could be done in the shop. I was advised to ring their customer service.I rang Customer Service (what a joke!)47 minutes later repeating the same information to 7different transfers I gave up. By the 7th transfer I asked to speak to a Supervisor no one available they were busy! Funny that!
Disgraceful experience Vodaphone, get your  act together.
I actually wanted to give thE a 0 star rating.

Appalling service. Complete inexperience. No knowledge.",1
Vodafone very unreliable,"I just had the most horrible experience in my life, talking with Vodafone customer support staff and their managers, [names removed].
Unhelpful and Untruthful customer support staff, supervisors, floor managers and complaints manager.",1
Changed dramatically,"I remember when I used to have 1 bar in my suburb of seaton, adelaide .. A few months ago I received a message to upgrade my cellular network and now I have full bars wherever I go. I think they have improved greatly and are now a very good network. I am getting speeds of up to 16-20 Mbps. That was not possible a year ago!",5
What customer service???,"Vodaphone is trying to convince me to join their network from CrazyJohn's, which is closing down. I have tried to get information on what the conditions of transfers will be, e.g. will all fees and charges be transferred or will Vodaphone transfer credits only or nothing at all. Simple one would think. After a dozen emails I finally was told to call the ""customer service"" (or lack thereof) 1300 number. Over 1 hour on the phone, 7 transfers, including to the now defunct Three branch of Vodaphone and I still don't know the conditions of transfer. Maybe Vodaphone should spend a bit less money in sponsoring motor racing and put the funds in customer service.... Not the company for me",1
Worst customer service.,"Been with them for over 10 years and they changed sooo much! I was left heartbroken when I talked to customer care for 6 whole [censored word removed] hours!!! They did not try to help and kept on transferring me to other departments. The worst warranty service and the call centre only have indians, making it so hard to understand them! The phone plans might be cheaper than other networks but when you're in trouble you're  on your own. I don't want anyone else to get stuck in my situation! I still have 1 year left but with no phone :,( Hope my review helps. Make a wise decision!! :)Cheap plans? Maybe?",1
Not advisable,I have had nothing but drama with Vodafone - not only is it terrible coverage compared to ALL other networks but the customer service is terrible. I have had to have my phone sent away and replaced twice now and have recieved very little compensation for the 2 months I have been without the handset I am paying for. I have spent more time in the shop trying to follow up what should be a very simple service then I have actually using my phone! I am now stuck in this contract until april .... do not make the same mistake!!!!,1
Terrible Connection,"I am using a vodafone for 6 months. I have 12 Month contract with a mobile and pocket wifi. Both have terrible reception where are live and I am living in Broadway, Sydney (CBD !!!). Constant disconnections from internet while using mobile broadband. Drops while talking on the phone. I am counting days to get rid of my contract and change my provider !!! By the way 4G network is terrible at Broadway.CheapTerrible reception, drops, disconnections, slow internet",1
Vodafone absolutely sucks,"I have been with 3 for many years after leaving Vodafone due to a lack of service and poor reception in some out of the way areas that I visit frequently. Now unfortunately Vodafone has wrecked a good service by buying them out (3)  I stayed with 3 as they still had roaming but since vodafone said that I am required to now join them by August with no roaming grrrrr. I went down to my Vodafone store to get my phone unlocked after the instructions on their web page failed I spent 3 hours updating files ect and the phone was still not unlocked.  The gentleman if you could call him that said oh we cant unlock the phones here it has to be done by you at home. I explained that I had already tried that with out success. I asked him how come he couldnt unlock the phone when I had one unlocked there only 2 months ago. 

He couldnt answer me. I was not at all polite to him and yelled in the store "" no wonder I am changing away from vodafone your service sucks""  I then decided to try the store 50 meters away and found a very cooperative young lady that had the phone unlocked in 10 min  I couldnt believe it.   I then rang vodafone customer service to ask for my account number so I could transfer my number to aldi I copped an ear full why are you leaving vodafone I said this is none of his business just give me my account # 8 times i had to ask him for my account number before he gave it to me I will never ever go to vodafone every again they are disgusting.

connectivity, customer service the lack there of.",1
Still Terrible.. No Change in their Poor service or Network,"Got a new plan from one of their Melbourne Store and was advised that there was 4G network in my area and would get excellent coverage however it was completely different experience. The calls kept on dropping off, I never saw 4G network on my phone within a week and the internet was barely usable in the evening.",1
Terrible service,"Originally with 3. Poor reception. When I called to cancel contract, was persuaded to move to Vodafone. Was promised that the location in question had reception. Not only was that false, but other locations previously okay did not have reception. Was promised dramatic improvements over the next 12 months, but saw absolutely no improvement in service. Stuck it out to the end of my contract. When I called to end my contract, received a ""yeah whatever"" response. Now with kogan. Btw was given a long lecture  y vodafone about the dangers of changing to kogan. At a fraction of the price, much better service. Been with them for about 4 months - no complaints. Two friends who have been with them for even longer - also no complaints. My opinion: take out a Vodafone contract at your peril. I was promised impending improvements, none of which materialised. The same promises are being made 18 months later. Beware!!!",1
Terrible,"I have used Vodafone both here and when visiting Germany. Both times I was overcharged. They offered me a prepaid to use on my iPhone, but asked me later if the phone was locked, which it was, by my employer. As I couldn't use it they also refused to refund me the $60.00 for the prepaid card, so I had to throw it away.",1
If I could give it zero stars I would!,"it was totally a Wrong decision to have entered into this 24 mth contract with Vodafone!!! With the poor internet connection All The Time, bad signals to make calls and delays on sending text msg All The Time, I am sure I am definitely not gonna return after contract finished!!Vodafail go listen to all this negative reviews from your customer and make some change!!!!",1
Pathetic Service,"I am with Vodafone ( not for long). i had no internet on my phone and tried several times to get their useless technical staff to try fix it. Still no internet. I have been applying for a new job and dealings with lawyers and relying heavily on checking my emails multiple times during the day. I had enough to the point where i want out. i am sick of going to internet cafes incurring costs and such inconvenience. I want Vodafone to cover any costs i have incurred but they refused. So i want out of contract, but the [censored word removed] think they going to charge me to release me form my contract. Well I don't fear large organisations, especially this [censored word removed] company... Bring it on Vodafail.

Staff can't speak English properly, missrepresentation and missleading information. No Dispute resolution skills whatsoever",1
Vodafone Fail,"I've been a member of Vodafone for nearly 10 years and have never been rewarded with service I would be even call good, I think I was a member before they outsourced their customer service overseas and it was horrible then aswell. Their 3G also sucks, even when I'm in the Sydney CBD and I constantly have to search for new signals just to do simple things like check my email. They don't seem like they care about customer retention.CheapSignal strength, customer service, no feeling of loyalty for longtime user",1
Any insult to Vodafone is a compliment to Vodafone and an insult to the insult as Vodafone is much w,"After years of being away from the rotten scoundrels i was in a hard place and allowed the rep to convince me they had changed to being a better carrier.Faaaar out was he lying through his teeth and how gullible I was to believe it.I transferred relying on that network guarantee, I ring Vodafone regarding another matter while I was in the  CBD while the operator asks me do I have any drop out issues and the phone call drops out before I could answer.She returns my call and gives me a reference number to have my contract cancelled without any other questions.
Do your self a favor and steer clear of these low life scum bags,

Cheers

Poor customer service network coverage is appalling no regard to costumer need manipulative money hungry",1
Good service,"My phone bill was double what it usually was last month due do going over on my data allowance, even though I have never gone over before. I rang Vodafone's Customer Care and the woman I spoke to was polite, helpful and explained everything clearly. She managed to get a credit applied to my account so the outstanding amount I have to pay now is only $10 more than what I pay per month. This was because I have been a customer for over six years and have never applied for a credit before. Very happy with the outcome.",4
Biggest piece of rubbish tel-co in australia,"Stuck on a 24 month contract 7 months to go. Counting the seconds till i switch to telstra at least il have reliable coverage and internet in the middle or 25 km from  the cbd, customer service is disgusting with constant off handing to the next person and rude patronizing managers. i have come to realize that paying 20 or 30 dollars more a month for telstra would have been a better decision than going with vodafone. delayed texts dropped calls little or no internet has cost me money and embarrassment.got an iphone 5 out of it",1
Worst reception,I signed up about 28 months ago had perfect 3g then vodadudsdecided to pull 3g bases down and leave only 2g mind you I'm 8kms from Melbourne cbd and Vodafone told me that I have no right to cancel contract mind you I put up with this since late 2012 went to T.I.O and got out of contract 16 months left had to pay 2 months and $300 for sony Xperia sIf anyone wants rÃ©ception use telstra !!!!cheap isnt always best !!!Cheap,1
Prepaid prices are through the roof!,"I have been a long time Vodafone Customer. I have been using their 365 Prepaid Accounts for a long time, due to my no-so-heavy mobile usage.",2
Network sucks. Why bother having mobile with no network in many places.,"Look I have been with Vodafone for 2 year. I was living in Cranbourne. I then moved to Bendigo coz of job moving. When I was in Cranbourne, they were frequently fixing network towers and my network was fluctuating. When I went to Bendigo, at my work place, there is just no network! After complaining for 2 weeks that please fix my network, they lodged investigation. Fair enough. It went on for 2 weeks there is still pending outcome. I said look, I cant not have network, due to thenature of work and my wife is still away. I got to talk to her and also while travelling between 2 cities, there are some spots where network really is not there meaning , GPS dont work ! I need to move to different network, they said they can give me discount but will not allow to waive contract. So basically, what they said is they are allowed to take my money and not provide adequate service and cage me in contract. They said, look go to Ombudsman, we cant help you. I cant believe that after 2 years of good relationship, it is just rude and inconsiderate and unreasonable to abruptly say things like this.
Great customer care service- usually people hear your problem and available to help you.
When it comes to network coverage, it sucks. You never know in your life when you have to move,I did not know I had to. So dont get into vodafone network where there is not good network. You can only do little with customer care. They cant replace good network.",1
Anyone rating higher than 1 star is delusional,"A) Terrible product in general. The rates are acceptable but how much would you pay for jack all?B) Customer service is terrible. Outsources to India. They should outsource to Philippines where the English is much better.C) You spend 50 minutes talking to a robot before you actually get a human beingD) That human being will then commence to tell you the same thing the robot lady was just saying only in a less understandable accent.E) Called the sales line and was connected almost instantly, funny how things work when they want your money.
F) These reviews need to be brought to the attention of the CFO or VP of vodafone because something needs to be done. The rage that I have felt because of this terrible carrier just might cause me to come and shoot up a building. And we all know which one.

Worst Telco Service..........Avoid Them,"So frustrating.  have you ever tried to call the service centre?  (It's in India) Don't waste your time.  Bureaucratic, abrupt, aggressive and un truthful.

I was so lucky to come across him otherwise I would of been driving for an hour to see a Telstra Tech as recommened by another store. Thanks Again.",5
Worst Carrier,"Do not choose vodafone, they will rip you off. The coverage is bad, the plans are expensive and the customer service is terrible.

Vodafone ....

Would give no stars if possible...,"This is the worst company i have ever dealt with, i honestly would give them no stars if possible.I have been with the for just over a year, but i'm on my partners existing contract so have technically been a customer for over 5 years, and i have had nothing but problems.They accidentally cancelled my contract and charged the fee to my account. Even though it was totally their fault it took a lot of back and forth and threat of an ombudsman to even get them to agree to refund me. This was all while i was still paying for my contract!!!Then came a long while where i received little to no signal at all. They were very unhelpful and explained that i lived and worked in poor signal areas (central sydney!)
Now, i've stopped being able to receive calls and texts and no one seems to be able to help. After hours on the phone, i've been trying to cancel my contract and they have offered me a $30 credit to my account - pathetic after 5 days with no phone use.
Never ever sign a contract with Vodafone",1
Vodafone have been excellent to me,"I've been with Vodafone for two years on the iPhone contract, On the $45 a month unlimited SMS and calls, Reception and coverage have been excellent in Perth and Kalgoorlie Boulder Everytime I have called they have fixed any problems I've had swiftly I highly recommend them to anyone. I have also been with virgin and Telstra and they are disgusting",5
Vodaphone- Awesome,"I went over my data for the month and called up pretty angry until I talked to a really friendly customer service operator over the phone who explained my bill to me, it made perfect sense and now I won't go over again! I am so impressed and will stay with vodaphone for a long time now. Honestly- if you have a problem just call up and they are really helpful, don't get all negative about it you will be surprised at how great they are!Excellent customer service",5
Never again,"I had a 2 years contract with vodafone and it should finish at the end of June, but i couldn't stand it anymore. I work at blackburne north, and most of the time my phone is in SOS. I couldn't receive any emergency calls from people, and the reception is terrible. Internet speed also slow, no point using this at all. so i made few complains in Box Hill counter, the people in there are useless, they said the company is planning to increase the reception by putting more access points, etc. They didn't give me a good explanation at the end.So i rather paid $140 to payout my plan than suffer with a phone that can not make/receive calls. 
 just get away from it. Will never try again

Poor reception , slow internet, expensive compare to others, poor service",1
"Run, run as fast as you can","This review is for service ending with Vodafone 2011engthy conversation with Mumbai (where I have a suspicion they use their accent to hide as many terms and conditions), they finally agreed to cancel my contract and I was to send the phone back. I sent the phone back. After several months...I was still charged because the phone had not arrived yet, even though the package was a self return from vodafone. 

The phone was finally found they agreed to cancel and refund my charges. Several more months past - they were still charging and there was no refund.

My final conversation involved the word - ombudsman and my contract was cancelled and payments refunded. This situation lasted over half a year. You can really a tell the reputation of a company by whether they only act on the word ombudsman and fair trading.

"Worst con artist, deceit and lies you can imagine","The worst form of deceit and lies ever. Even escalating the problem does not help. They seem to think they are exempt from the law.  I spent hours on the phone where they make empty promises for delivering phones, adding wrong amounts to bill, wrong delivery address ( very questionable)l, etc. This is biggest scam group and the operators are trained to lie and mislead the customers and they are extremely skilled in it. Even the managers pretend to be helping when all they are doing is taking the lies a notch further. We are utterly disgraced and deeply disappointed in this terrible company. Media should investigate what is going on. Still waiting for a phone more than a month later and another A few weeks late.",1
TERRIBLE COVERAGE,"I transferred my business account from Telstra to Vodafone.  Calls drop out and in some cases every second word cannot be heard.  Was promised exactly the same coverage as Telstra, told no contracts.  Guess what, coverage is substandard and not like Telstra and I have been charged over $1500 to move back to Telstra.  I have lost business because of Vodafone.  Save yourself the heartache!",1
Shocking slow 4G,I just checked my Vodaphone 4G using Internet speed test with Server at Sydney -- and I was totally shock of the result: 0.12Mbps download and 1.4Mbps upload.Is that the speed of a 4G network that they provide for their client? Shocking.,1

HAHAHAHAAA",1
No Service. Not receiving phone calls or texts.,"I had been with vodafone for years and knew their coverage was bad but as I rarely used my phone it didn't bother me much. A few months ago I stopped getting any coverage at all. I was missing calls from work, missing shifts and could not send or receive texts. As I live in a city area I thought it might have been my phone, as it was a few years old so I purchased a new phone but still no coverage. Hubby and I would sit side by side at the kitchen table and could not call or text each other. I changed carriers and have had no issues since.  Terrible coverage and the prepaid plans are expensive. $30 for 28 days of poor coverage (drops in and out)",1
Bad Online Support Team,"I wanted a 12pro max, I tried to order my phone twice and they get it wrong at the first time ( wrong product, wrong address), then I tried to order again, after everything done I didnâ€™t get any receipt.

Poor customer service,Vodafone had advertised that Sony PS5 was available via a preorder on the 12th of Nov 2020 and to phone from 8 am to place order. I made calls and opened online chats at 8 am sharp  . Was on hold for over 45 minutes and online chat came  up with error upon placing order. Two hours later I was informed I could not place an order because I was a business customer. It took two hours and multiple operators to tell me that I could not order a device despite have four active accounts with Vodafone. I am now considering finding an alternate provider in hope that my time is treated in a more valuable way. Admittedly  the last person I spoke to in Vodafone offered me a discount on my account as a way of apologising.,1
WORST NETWORK EVER,"Worst customer service, I have been calling them for about an hour and nobody has answered the calls yet.... the internet is very very slow, signals dropping out all the time. With the max speed also, it cannot buffer youtube videos.  DON'T choose the Vodafone ever. I haven't experienced another provider but I am 100% sure, they are better than this.",1
Customer Service has gone to hell,"I joined Vodafone Australia because they 'HAD' a good service. Now, forget it, best go to small cheap carrier such as Belong or Lenora. I was going to stay, because other carriers, probably are overseas owners, but receiving their service, both on the phone line and Live chat (should be DEAD chat), I'm leaving Vodafone. I feel like one I am on a contract, they just treat me like sshitt",1
Like a snail,Big companywith 0% customers service and net is slower than snail. Never satisfy with this vodafone data and also adsl. Had to choose different internet.,1
Don't wanna give even 1 star.,Bad. Very bery Bad. Extremely Bad. Signals dropping out all the time. Slowest of all the internet providers. I spoke with Vodafone team poor customer service. Well not their fault. If internet is bad there's nothing they can do about it. I am changing my provider. Don't get fooled by the stupid offers. They don't have good internet. Their offers means nothing.,1
Canâ€™t fix simple problems,My number has been saying Optus number is disconnected but Iâ€™m with Vodafone. Some people can call and some canâ€™t. Complained repeatedly still not fixed.,1
I highly suggest you do not choose Vodafone,"I would rate them -5.I have a business and personal plan.I have been experiencing terrible network coverage and constant dropouts for months now.  I have called Vodafone numerous times, since March this year this has been an ongoing issue and has not been resolved.I was told to change my settings, my sim and apparently towers have been getting put up each month and to be patient! Yeah right, so I was told but it was all lies just bad network and service. I do not reccomend. My family and I will be changing networks. Choose wisely.",1
No go Vodaphone,I have been a loyal vodaphone customer for many years.utilizing Vodaphone  amongst family and friends.the free time offered between mobiles was attractive.Recently Vodaphone decided to cancel my and others accumulated  free minutes.4500 free minutes in my case.Their mobile coverage was never even close to on par to the Telstra network.Cancelling users free minutes was unloyal and unethical to long term  loyal customers.,1
Vodafone- 3G as worst as it gets,"Can't believe I' m taking time to write this review. Really, Vodafone coverage in Melbourne is worst ever. 3G coverage is bad as anything, in recent months it hasn't been working. The pending circle thing appears and then it says connection timed out. Did everything but to no avail. It doesn't help even with the fact that I got the add-on extra gb of 3g. What a waste of money +20 bucks everymth because the bloody 3G is not even bloody working. I am gonna cancel all this extra Internet and switch operators when the contract's up. Am sure with the bill of 100 bucks per mth in average, I can get teletra or some other operators with better connectivity.",1
Just awful,"I have tried to be a loyal vodafone customer but gave up today to switch to Telstra. There service has been continually bad with no reception in the centre of Sydney. My contract was about to expire and I asked about signing a new contract, explaining that the current contract they were offering was the same cost as Telstra/Optus but with markedly worse coverage.initely better coverage. THe one good thing about vodafone in the past was they were cheaper. That is not even true anymore
They didn't arrange for an assassin to hunt me down. They offered me a generous $4 off my contract",1
Don't have a problem,A lot of people say Vodafone is bad. I have no problem with Vodafone coverage is the same as Telstra. Great value and great deals. I have been with Telstra before and it's a rip off way to expensive. I would give Vodafone 5/5 also the call centre is great and very help full. Vodafone is still the best value network.Great,5
Overcharged every month,"Excellent vodafone fudging overcharge customers, and its not like 10 or 20 bucks, but 100-400 dollars more. Never gonna use vodafone again in my life.Worst experience ever.Bad customer service and network coverage at the same time. I don't even know why this company exists in Australia. Please disappear.",1
Was all good until I ended my contract.,"I couldn't believe this company.  I had been a faithful customer of theirs for the duration of my contract.  Once my contract had ended, and I needed access to my invoices/statements, they were going to make me pay $5.50 per statement.  It's not even about the money.  The letters I got from the consultant were rude, abrupt, and nasty.  To think I was considering returning to Vodafone.  Never again!  There are better and more affordable options out there that know how to give polite customer service.It was okay.Honestly:  They have no clue when it comes to customer service.",2
PocketWifi and Vodafone = Worst choice ever!,"Worst Reception, slow speeds and always cuts out, that is exactly what you're gonna receive from Vodafone. Even when both my Phone and PocketWifi used to say 3G or H, the speeds were still incredibly slow. I will never recommend to anyone to Vodafone as I'd rather see their money being put to something better.",1
I'd be better off with 2 cans and a piece of string.,"If you don't ever make calls, send messages or use the internet on your phone, Vodafone is the company for you. If you do, Vodafone is definitely not the company for you. I live in Adelaide city, I don't get reception. I try and call customer support, it drops out every time I'm speaking to the Indians.",1
Total let down,"Where do I start? That's how terrible they ared family 
- Hidden charges, Please watch your usage... They tend to add things to your bill and won't explain what for... Or they don't tell you when a service costs extra. 

- 2weeks bill notice... It's not long enough... I'm always calling for an extension.
- Poor SERVE customer service... Customer service providers via phone are often rude, unhelpful and frustrating... They don't explain things clearly and when you ask to to repeat they talk slow as though you're dumb... In store customer service is just as bad as they tell you to phone customer service!!! 

- Nothing but problems... Sadly have to call almost every month about something... something is always wrong... I canno wait to finish my contract with Vodafone...There phone plans prices sound like good value. But you don't get the expected value... TOTAL LET DOWN!",1
Just a joke!,"Since they are trying to upgrade to 4 G, it is just a joke. No reception , Not even 3G just H+That's now more than 6 month that it is like that.In my building, i can receive all other network but Vodafone is really up and down Really annoying.Just call them to ask compensation about this terrible service.As soon as my contract is finished i go else where.",1
The worst,Just moved from 3 to vodafone no reception really hard to deal with over the phone. the solution given to me for no reception was they would unlock my phone and i could use a different phone company sim card when there service fails what a joke. so everyone be warned don't use vodafone wish i had read these reviews before signing up. thankfully im in the cooling off period of 30 days. after ten years with 3 with no problems its back to telstra for some good old fashion network coverage,1
Shocking service,"I pay $2 each month to have a paper bill. Last month Vodafone did not send it out. I then asked for another bill. I was told to send out a bill to replace the missing one it would be an additional $5 plus a late fee of $10. In addition my husband and I have had the worst reception since we signed up with vodafone with line drop outs and horrible reception with weird sound effects in the background as background noise. Big mistake to go with this company i will be leaving and going to another provider. No point ringing them to speak to them about the issues the people on the phones act like they dont know what you are saying and keep you waiting for hours and never resolve your issues. If you try to email them the email from their website conveniently does not work.

horrifying customer service",1
Couldn't be worse,"After being changed from 3 to Vodafone the service received is simply a disgrace. When I complained it was explained to me that the reason for the very slow service is the old equipment. I was sweet talked into signing up again by giving me a good discount and new equipment. However, while I now don't pay much, I am wasting so much time with this incredible slow and unreliable service that it is actually quite expensive considering the lost time. When I complained I was told that I need to refresh my access every now and then. What a nonesense!",1
Poor service &amp; reception,"I was a Vodafone customer for around 10 years, with back to back mobile phone contracts. I also had a mobile internet contract at a point in time. The network really did deteriorate badly in the later years and I was subjected to phone dropouts and internet timeouts on an all too frequent basis. long term customer I would have liked a bit more respect in this period, my complaints were genuine and reasonable. 

Vodafones customer service is a draining experience.

I wouldn't recommend this network to anybody, especially now with less disparity in the pricing with competitors.

Phone reception patchy, internet slow and patchy, customer service poor",1
Unethical company,I was a loyal three/Vodafone customer for more than three years. When I called to cancel my mobile broadband they offered 6 months at no extra charge. Little did I know that once the 6 months was up they began to charge me again (they failed to advice me this when I agreed to the offer) even though I specified that I was cancelling the  account as I had switched to another Internet provider and had no intention of continuing. Obviously the offer of 6 months was their sly way of keeping the account open and continuing to charge once it lapsed rather then a genuine reward for being a loyal customer. They were rude and dismissive on the phone when I rang to complain. Big thumbs down.,1
No reception at home,"Not only do my phone calls constantly drop out, I do not receive reception on my mobile phone in my own home which is located in the middle of Sydney. The website says that this suburb has coverage. My friends who have been to my home that are also on Vodafone also did not receive coverage on their mobiles either. My boyfriend on Telstra receives full coverage in our home. shop, they gave me a new sim card. This did not work either. Fed up, I called again and to compensate, customer service said they would give me a 3 month discount on my bill. The discount will not resolve the coverage issue, however. Frustrated, I talked to the supervisor wanting to cancel my plan without incurring early exit fee. I was told that this could not be done as my current address is a moved address, different from the address at which I had signed up with. (??? Vodafone should have coverage at the suburb that I live in as stated on their website!). He then said that Vodafone does not guarantee 100% coverage in all areas. (??? How about 0% coverage in an area that Vodafone claims should have coverage?). He then said that he will take this matter to technical support (stalling time!!!), which I begrudgingly obliged to. He said it will take 3 working days. It has been 4 working days already with no result and after calling 1555 again today, they told me a result will come about in 2 more days. (How much more stalling, vodafone?! I am at my wits end!!!). 

All in all, I am frustrated beyond  belief. The service is unsatisfactory, unacceptable and unbelievable. I only hope that my complaint with the TIO will give me relief from this telecommunication nightmare.",1
Worst network inside Melbourne zone one,"I have vodafone mobile and broadband bth are worst..never buy.. trust me, if i hadn't signed up i'd pay $5 more go for optus or pay $10 more better go for telstra.. Every time you go internet after 9 you cannot connect..they say 3 G network its slower then 2G network..So never buy vodafone",1
Vodafone service is Unbelievably bad,"My main complain is the customer service. My contract finished recently so I rang to check my options. - The lady advised me that I can keep my old plan but pay only for phone. I told her to put me on contract without me checking anything. While entering the contract, she told me that the delivery is usually $10 but she will write off. I realized something is not right as it is advertised everywhere Vodafone delivery is free.When I asked her to give me a price for Samsung phone, she told me she can not do it as the order for the new contract is already in. I told her that in Australia here me have 24 hours cooling off period. I realised, I was tricked into a contract so I gave myself 1/2 hour to think about everything. After 1/2 hour,  I rang to cancel the order as I did not want any contract with Vodafone nor I wanted anything to do with them. I asked for reference number as I did not trust them. Then I went to Bankstown Vodafone where I was advise that my order is cancelled but takes 24 hours for the computer to update. Today, Vodafone rang me advising me that the order was sent and they could not cancel it. I requested to speak with a manager but their reply was  the manager would  tell me the same thing. So I had no chance to speak with manager. Then I rang again to put a complaint so I was directed to business care department. The guy advise me that Vodafone does not have 24 hours cooling off period. As soon as the order is in, they can not cancel it even if you ring them 1/2 hour later. The only option that I have now if I don't want to be charged is to pick up the parcel from  Australia Post and sent it back to them otherwise I will be charged. I told them that I am working full time and I am not taking day off because their system is not made for Australian standards. So now I have a burden to fix Vodafone system problems. It's extremely frustrating , waste of time to speak with Vodafone customer service.

 Being Vodafone customer for 12 years, finally I am going back to Telstra. I just hope that they will have better customer service. 

I am keep asking myself ""Where is the good customer service"" I even asked to speak with somebody in Australia. Apparently Vodafone does not have anybody in Australia who looks after complains relating to Australian standards and Vodafone. I am disappointed and a bit scared what will the future bring with such a low customer service oriented companies in Australia. 

Today I went to get small sim card in Menai shopping center - Allphones, I was impressed with the young boy who was so knowledgeable, polite, helpful etc. My husband told me that after dealing with Vodafone customer service everything is beautiful. Through this experience I learn to appreciate and have a gratitude for our excellent old fashion face to face customer service.",1
Terrible reception and service,Calls drop out.Messages send in multiples.Voice calls often scrambled.Pathetic excuses from customer service team stating they are trying to improve network and I am offered a discount.Investigations never reveal any faults.I have complained to telecommunications ombudsmen and am demanding my contract be terminated and all fees wavied.Never Sign Up With Vodafail.,1
Reception,Vodafone has the worst reception service! No matter what area I am in I have little to no reception. Every time I go to send a message I have to hit resend around 8-10 times sometimes more for it to go through. This should be worked on if they want to keep customers.,1
Excellent service at a great price,"I read a lot of reviews about people having poor service and bad coverage with Vodafone, and when you look at the phones they use - you can see why. In October 2012, my father took me to get an iPhone 4S on Vodafone's $49 cap plan (in which Vodafone were willing to give us a 10% discount on because we were adding it to my father's already existing contract). Since then, I've never had a problem or been in an area that I deem to be a ""black-spot"". When you see the problems people have with Vodafone, you often find that the complaints are predominantly coming from Android and Blackberry users relating to the functionality of their phone. Seldom do you ever see a complaint filed about an Apple iPhone. This isn't just a trend I've noticed with Vodafone users, but also Optus, Telstra, and other major Australian telco's. Vodafone are providing an excellent service at a very decent price - but please don't be stupid and buy an Android phone to go with it. You'll have nothing but long term problems and expensive repairs! Go with iPhone or go with nOphone. Vodafone provide excellent service - it's the device you use to access it that can let you down.
Reliable service, decent price, and outstanding customer support.
iMessage occasinoally (but rarely) fails to send, requiring me to hit the resend button. However, always works second time.",5
"The product is fine, the customer service is awful.","Over the duration of my 2 year contract vodafone has:Initially vodafone lost all record of me as a customer including the paper copy of the contract I signed (somehow the massively overcharged bills still managed to find me though hmm..) This took months to resolve and required the involvement of the telecommunication ombudsman. However, it was eventually resolved and Vodafone did apologise and refund some of the overcharged bills. them at least once about it every time I go away but never get any sort of result, or any apology for the inconvenience of being without communication for weeks at a time.

My main complaint with Vodafone is the poor customer service, both in store and via the help lines. Its the most unhelpful, rude and lazy I have come across. You always have to call multiple times to resolve even small issues and the attitude of the staff is appalling. I recently switched to Virgin and the improvement was immediately obvious.
Good value plans (when they work), good coverage
non-existent customer service, the worst",2
Misled... belittled... never fulfilled a single promise,"Had an issue with Wife's bills, so I called up the customer service centre to enquire. Originally we were overcharged about $330 on a bill, so I just want to enquire and have it fixed.nager about this, he misled me to my face with something the previous consultant just informed me of who I spoke with, looked to speak with his manager, said about the same thing, than after about 30 minutes, finally caught him out. His attitude was also rude and poor. Like he didn't give much about my experiences, tried to brush me off by keep saying, ok I will send you a text after this call, I'll give you updates later!!

Never got a single text or call... I told them I wanted to escalate the complaint never had any word back since. 

This happened in December 2012... It's now Feb 2013.

Mobile Services,"I transferred to Vodafone from 3 after their amalgamation/take-over because I wanted an iPhone with more than 16GB of memory.  I undertook a 12month contract with a 64GB iphone, it was a fair deal considering what was available else where.  I was also loyal to 3 as i had been with 3 for many years.  I have experienced few service issues with Vodafone but find it difficult to understand why I cannot remain under my $79.00 cap.  My account is  never under $110.00 yet I a have this massive $500+ cap value.  My mobile data allowance is small.  I've picked Vodafone because they are my service provider but as a search the net all the plans offered by service providers are around the same.
The transfer process from 3 to Vodafone was simpe and easy, due to my tenure with Vodafone they have been very generous when I have been late with my monthly account.
Vodafone's call centre constantly trying to onsell other products or push for an upgrade, never staying under a cap regardless of the fact that i have reduced calls.  Vodafone customer services is a long waiting process only to be referred on to another dept and placed in the call queue again after 30 minutes initially",3
Disappointed,"Bought $50 prepaid starter kit for my son online in February. Activated with no problems. However, when tried to make a phone call for the first time, it told me ""Insufficient funds, please recharge"". What happened to my $50?Called the 1300 number, spent almost 1 hr explaining and waiting before receiving any resolution, which ended with me having to show them my bank statement. I was a happy customer for 3 yrs, now not sure anymore.",1
Coverage and service,"Been a three customer for many years way back in the days of CDMA, since the changeover to Vodafone towers coverage anywhere outside metropolitan Melbourne is very poor; roaming onto the Telstra network is now almost non existent despite them saying this would not change. If you talk to four different customer service people you will get four different answers. All in all an absolute disgrace, they should be shut down and all customers release3d from contracts.",2
Overcharged,I was shocked to receive a  $450 bill. I had an 8 mo at the time & could not see how they found that I had spent that kind of money. I have no time to surf the net & don't know the full capabilities of my ph. Lodging a complaint only reduced the bill by $100 I will be leaving this provider as soon as I get a minute.ive never been late on bills & my bill was always $71- VF is a  Rip off targeting everyday people.,1
Stuffed my credit rating,In 2005 I cancelled and paid out my service sick of poor coverage. End of story you would think but no for the next 5 years they charged for a paper statement that I never received.In 2010 they put this in the hands of debt collection and listed it on my credit file in 2011.I only found out because of a credit application I made in 2013 and was rejected because of vodafones stuff up.,1
Avoid like the plague,"Do yourself a favor and avoid anything to do with Vodafone, the frustration of having to deal with unreliable service and hopeless customer care is enough to drive you beyond insanity. Words can't come close. I have been told by Vodafone today that the reason the service is so bad (worse than usual for past 6 months) is because they are trying to improve the service. Really?",1
"Don't do it, just don't it's not worth it.","First normally I barely use the phone to make calls I text my partner a fair bit maybe 7 times a day I pay 30 dollars plus 5 dollars for extra data and have an HTC sensation that is already faulty after a year (not vodafones fault) My bill is always over 35 dollars usually 40 to 60 dollars a month however the data and Phone Signal drops out lots  even though I live in Cronulla Sydney . Spoke to the useless customer service people in the local vodafone store and was promised signal upgrades in a few months etc etc and after a year the signal is still dropping out halfway through calls I barely use the phone for calls and still eat through my limit every month just texting and if you are unfortunate enough to use your call limit which is easy to do then they really get you on call charges . I exceeded my 180 dollar credit on the 30dollar plan by phoning a home landline in melbourne and was billed over a dollar a minute plus when the signal dropped out and I had to call again I got charged more for multiple calls and an hour and a half cost me around 200 dollars which is just plain greedy  ! My bill this month after ringing landlines in Melbourne for a family emergency is over 300 dollars and in that are a few 1 hour plus calls - Sneaky charges for reasonable use . I wouldnt mind if they provided a decent phone signal . Also have a mobile broadband device it also suffers from the poor data connection and is basically rubbish . Am getting a landline with a decent company . Vodafone are not that cheap in the end and its better to stick with a reputable company and pay a bit more to not have problems . Honestly dont be taken in by the seemingly cheap offers . Customer service is in Bombay by the way need I say more !! They will lose 3 accounts for just being terrible, only problem is am on a contract for another 14 months am so disappointed am considering buying it off just to get out of it . They are only ok if you dont use your phone for anything and dont need a consistant signal !!",1
Very good. Cant complain.,Many people have said how bad vodafone are but in my own experience I have found them to be really good. I travel around australia for work a fair bit and ive never had issues with reception. Never have not been able to make calls. Sometimes depending on the area the data speeds can feel a bit slow but in general its usually pretty good.Price. Service.Slow data speeds occasionally when in more remote areas.,5
Worst service ever,"Their charges are way overpriced. Specially if you have credit and want to call overseas, their per/min charge is highest compared to over companies. Sometime 100% to 300% over priced, i called then about this and they said will forward this to relevant dept but i never got a call back from anyone. Signal is really really bad, freaquent drop outs, 3g network to access internet is 75% of time not working. You only have to look into their forum to see how many people are disappointed with this company. I do not even know how they can operate with the sort of service they are providing.Entice you with new phones to stay with their network.Bad service, bad signal or dropout frequent, overpriced overseas calls.",1
Good!!,"Yes there are drop outs, mainly with Internet (fixed by a quick airplane mode) but on the whole I have great service coverage (very rarely below 3 bars) Call center staff arehelpful, no long waits to get someone on the phone and Ive never encountered anyone rude. Theyve also been very patient if I've ever not been able to pay a bill on time and given extensions of up to two weeks whilst reactiving the service no charge. Happy with price and my current plan as majority of friends are also with Voda it works out to be great value.",4
vodafone australia,vodafone is the best company i have had all the ppl are nice i have had discounts and they helped me pay out a 300 internet bill im glad im with vodafone custmor care are very nice thay paied my internet bill witch made me so grateful and thay have gaven me a discount thanks custmor care .they gave me discounts n good company n there if i was struggling,5
Handed over for Collection by ADR Do Not Pay they will not remove the credit report.,"In August 2012 we became aware of an adverse credit report against us by Vodafone 1n 2010. When I called VF they told me we did not return one handset. Despite the fact that we did, we could not prove it, two years later we do not have a receipt.I asked how I can get the adverse credit report removed and was told to contact ADR who informed me if I pay the approx. $1300 they will remove the adverse report. As I needed this to be removed I reluctantly paid, as I still maintain we did not owe this.moved. I contacted ADF and spoke to [name removed] who now maintain they do not remove these reports. I asked why I was told if I paid it would be removed. She just replied thatâ€™s the way it is.

I called Vodafone and spoke to [name removed] and his manager [name removed] who now both tell me they do not remove reports even if you pay.

This is blackmail deceit and lies just to collect monies they are claiming from you even if you dispute the claim.

A warning to anyone who has been handed over to ADR. Do not pay. They will not remove your credit report even if you do.",1
Absolutely hopeless,"I recently cancelled my contract with Vodafone due to payment discrepancies.ovider as my contract was due to expire. Once I had cancelled and signed up with another provider I thought my ties were over.

But how I was wrong! They have now sent me a bill for early contract termination fees - even though I cancelled my contract after my contract had expired.

worst experience i ever had,vodafone is the worst service i ever had...............i have used three(3) services for seven years and just two months with vodafone these people are greedy....just charging me for nothing......i had to pay what i hav not even used......i spoke to there representative and no results........they are all call centre people sitting out there without knowledge of the produyct.....every single day i ring them to fix my account every single time i get different information..........i have few people in my family and freinds circle who were using vodafone services and they are all disconnecting.....terrible.....,1
Do not get Vodafone,"I am an exchange student from the United States and I am in Australia for 1 year so I went ahead and got a contract with Vodafone. Worst decision since I arrived. I have terrible service in my dorm. They added the wrong data plan on to my bill and now won't take it off. They told me the wrong information about when I am doing international travel and so now they have charged me an obscene amount of money for making a few calls while in the US. They said they would take it off because I received incorrect information and it is still there. I now have a $130 bill instead of the $50 it is supposed to be. Do not go with them. They will overcharge you and give you incorrect information. I tried to cancel my plan 2 weeks after getting it, they said they were putting up more towers where I live and would give me $15 off for 3 months if I stay with them while they were building them. Guess what? The reception is still terrible and now I am stuck with them!

Expensive, terrible reception, in store reps give out incorrect information",1
The worst network in Australia,"Vodafone is the worst network in Australia, I get almost no reception, and when it says I do the internet doesn't work, it constantly times out. They lie to you and constantly say they are going to build towers near you but never do, I have to walk onto the street to use the phone and I live in Geelong. I tried cancelling my contract but they don't let me. I am changing to telstra as soon as my contract expires.",1
worst service ever,"i was with  3 for aprrox 8 years and very happy, switched over to vodafone as they told me the service would be better than 3...... Wrong its the worst service ever! fighting with them to get out of my contract but not that easy.",1
Taking advantage of consumers who can't speak English,"One of your CSR / Sales rep Martin from HQ called my father on 25/10/2012 and persuaded him into signing an additional contract to get a mobile broadband data sim along with his new contract, where in fact you can clearly tell my father didn't want it as he didn't really understand him, and never agreed to signing this additional contract! We receievd the USB by post (posted from Melbourne whereas we live in Sydney) and my father subsequently phoned Vodafone and was told that ""it's free of charge, if you don't need it, don't worry about it, just keep it."" Well, he just received his recent bill and got charged an additional $30. After calling your office last night, the CSR told us ""this additional charge was for the data sim."" I thought it was free of charge?! However the CSR went on and said ""he signed the contract at HQ!"" 

Can you please tell me:
1. How did he sign the contract when he only received a phone call from a CSR and never ever walked into a Vodafone store?
2. I was holding onto the contract thoughout the whole conversation and can confirm that it's completely blank with no signatures!

I don't know who 'falsified' my father's signature, but I certainly suggest that you ask your sales reps and CSRs that if it is clear that the person on the other side of the phone isn't fluent in English, do not take advantage of them! This is considered highly unprofessional and makes me wonder why Vodafone is contracting so much negativity in the past few years!

Level of integrity, highly unprofessional CSRs",1
Greedy company without an appropriate service,"Got a plan from the Vodafone for a 1 year. And from this moment all my problems have started. They presented me wi fi broadband data as a gift and later on started to charge for it, sent enourmously high bills even though I had a fixed plan. Had to argue and bargain every time. Now my contract has finished and it took me 3 days to call to the service centre and ask them to cancel my numbers, after being said that numbers are cancelled on the next day discovered that my numbers still with Vodafone and I had to call them back again and again. Finally I transferred my existing number to another mobile provider but Vodafone still sending me bills for that cancelled numbers. Tired to fight with them. Extremely terrible service! If you have choice please choose another mobile provider.  
Dinara",1
Cancellation of Service Charge!,"For dongle broadband monthly services, Vodafone charge  you a one month normal fee after you cancel a service, even if there is no use of the service. They claim it is ok to do that because it is in the contract! But only like Vodafone  justify charging for a service that is cancelled and they don't provide. Disgusted with this policy. Call centre hopeless. One person says you are eligible for a credit and they will process it and then another demand arrives! Never ever use them!",1
Vodafail is useless,"I cant believe how useless Vodafail is.Ive just come off 10 years from Optus on cable.Their prices keep going up and up and up.It seems like they think everyone is made of money.At least it works fast and can watch all videos at fast speed,but just too much with their lock in contracts.I decided to give Vodafail a go.What a monumental mistake that was.It seems weve gone back at least 12 years.Cant watch any videos on Youtube or anywhere else.Takes 30 mins to download a 2 minute clip. Dont even waste your money.Use it for something better.Slow as a snail to load up pages.An absolute waste of hard earnt money.Picture this and i bet they have in Vodafails boardroom.If we can sell 100 million internet plug im modems we can make a fortune .At $49AUD times 100 million users.Ill let you work it out.Theyre phone service is ok,but as for internet,absolute rubbish.Needless to say ill be throwing the Vodafail modem in the bin where it belongs like the others.

Doesnt work",1
Such a let down!,"I was with Optus for 4yrs and wanted to try Vodafone after a close friend said how happy they were. Total mistake! With my mobile I have no clear reception at my house, I need to stand on the street to have a proper phonecall.",1
Awful Service and Reception,Can not understand customer service is the biggest problem. Calls cut in and out. Very poor reception in all areas of Queensland. Promises of better service by certain time frames not met. You get what you pay for... Happy to have left Vodafone over a year ago and gone to another service provider. Do not recommend Vodafone,1
No phone reception,"I signed up with Vodafone because they said there was coverage in my area, well that may have been true if I walked about a kilometer up the road or if I was lucky I could find a point in my house but I couldn't breath or move or the phone would drop out and Vodafone didn't care so I had to pay 2 years for nothing.  The service from them left a lot to be desired.  After 2 years of service and reception the kids went to them and are now having the same problem, they say because they were cheaper. Well you get what you pay lesson learned.The only good help I got from a staff member was to go to another companyPhones will drop out even in major suburb areas",1
So so,"Previous 5 years dealing with Vodafone have really been a hit and miss scenario. From long waiting time on hold , to finally getting through to someone who barely speaks English, extremely poor reception in my area which by vodafone is classsed as a high reception area. However the purchase and set up recently of my iPhone 5 have been nothing short of some weird miracle. No waiting times on hold, clear English speaking sales representives, but best of all I now have crystal clear reception all the time.",3
Poor service.,I have requested a copy of my contract with vodafone due to them over charging me for a so-called cancelled contract. The contract was only for 12 months but they claim it was 24 months. They are wrong but will not acknowledge it. So now i have been charged $500 more than what i should have. I recommend no-one takes on a vodafone account as they are hopeless!,1
Bad customer service and the worst coverage,HaHa the funniest thing is they told me that they are going to improve the towers and asked me to wait one month (so that I will be finishing off my call off period) then ones I call back after one month they asked me to pay cancelation fee.. I clearly mentioned to make a note about cancelation if I don't get proper coverage but the ideate I spoke to didn't do that.. now I fought with them for 6 weeks and got frustrated and have to go with ombudsmen.. have to wait and see what will happen.. I highly don't recommend Vodafone if you are looking for service or networkgood plansBad customer service and the worst coverage,1
$550.20 for Standard,"I have been with Vodafone since I got my first phone at 12. The reception is terrible and always has been as is the service. When I upgraded to my new plan I took up the option of being notified when I had gone over my cap, however Vodafone failed to notify me of this and my bill came to $550.20. The most ridiculous part of this whole bill is that the $550.20 was for standard national calls. I pay $50 every month and have never gone over my cap. I make the same amount of calls every day which would probably be to my boyfriend who is also with Vodafone which makes it free. Some of these ""fees"" are confusing. I never received the added service which I wanted for being notified once my bill was over my monthly cap.

Lack of service, Offering a service that is later forgotten and which is the cause of stress.",1
$550.20 for Standard,I completely understand your stress. I made my boyfriend switch from 3 to Vodafone and he was so disappointed it was not funny. He couldn't receive my calls let alone his friends or family from overseas. Vodafone has been in this industry for so long it is really time for them to step up in terms of service and product offerings otherwise everyone will go home disappointed.,1
Vodafone good for International calls,"I have been with Vodafone for around three years now and have been relatively satisfied with the service. I think their deals are great for international callers. I would not recommend this for people who call locally, or live in remote areas. Have had one or two hiccups with the network, but I think two or three hiccups in three years - can't really complain!",4
Poor Customer Service,"Well today I signed up with Vodafone for a twelve month contract, followed the instructions, added in my postcode which generated the correct address. However, when the email came through confirming my order it was missing one important line of the address, although the postcode is correct. Well, I thought not a problem, I will give them a call, explain the program error and add it in - but no, the Customer Service team told me they can't help because I don't have an account as yet. They suggested I call back when the account has been established. I asked to speak to a Supervisor or Manager and after putting me on hold for ages, they said that this was not possible until I have a phone number. So it seems, I am expected to wait for the phone to be sent to the wrong address (which is due to a fault in their program) and then try to mop up the mess. Wow - I wish I had never chosen Vodafone!

Poor Customer Service / Systems",1
Good in spite of its flaws! Especially for international calls!,"I have been with Vodafone for many many years, and in spite of the obvious flaws (coverage) they do their best to help. Over the ast two years I had issues with my phone (Nokia N8), same happened in previous year with another one, and in both cases they changed the mobiles. I have also been credited for problems with the network and if for some reason I was running out of credit (and I am in a 69dollars plan (for a bit more than 700 dollars call) , I called them and they gave me extra 50 dollars in calls. The best for me is being able to call internationally as part of your cap. I wouldn't change, they are not perfect but they are the best for me. Cost/value :)Customer service. Good plans!Occasional issues with the coverage",4
Couldn't be happier with Vodafone!,"Customer service (phone service) is exceptional! They have really improved recently and they will do anything to make you happy! I have called them this week numerous times, and each time they have been so professional, polite, and willing to help me in any and every way possible.They happily matched a plan of another company to keep my husband with them (he's now on an iPhone with 3gb of data, rather than 1.5 and pays a dollar less per month too exactly match the other company's offer!They even authorised me to come into store and swap a faulty iPhone 5 handset on the spot! They will bend over backwards and do anything to ensure that you are happy.

I have never had a problem with coverage and have travelled rurally with minimal reception issues.
Overall, a fanastic phone network and I absolutely couldn't be happier. 
(Have been with Telstra, Virgin and Optus in the past. Even though Telstra's coverage never fails - they are expensive and have absolutely shocking customer service. Vodafone is by far the best!)
exceptional customer service through their support line, reliable, relatively inexpensive, good coverage",5
hopeless to say the least,"have been with them for over two years ,numerous times have complained about business calls dropping out suggested change to h&c(just as hopeless) Complained once again & they said would cut bill in half (still didn't change service same complaints still happening---How embarrassing for my business.My phone bill is up to date  the battery charged on my HTC ,the phone has no signal can't contact customers & they can't contact me.The 1555 service now cannot be contacted It looks like prepaid phones are the only way to go with TELSTRA.the rest of them have obviously joined ranks.I will be seeking legal adviceinthe next couple of days this is costing me a fortune through their incompetence
sales staff at toowong shopping centre excellent and did try to help(poor devils no back up support)
service does not exist Their attitude get the buck at all cost forget the service",1
"Very bad services, big mistake switch to vodafone","For the first time switch to vodafone, the iPhone 4 that I received was faulty.... The customer service not help at all, I have to go to apple by myself and they replace it NOT vodafone. Most of the time, no signal on my mobile phone.Never switch to vodafone.",1
Terrible service - call centre,"Had a frustrating experience with Vodafone's telephone support. I joined with Vodafone around four-five months ago and signed up to a $29/month plan. this month's bill arrived at $112. I was utterly shocked with the bill and called customer service. I spoke to an uninterested employee working in a call centre in India. He gave me the usual generic aswers that they are drilled into saying no doubt. I couldn't properly explain my confusion or my issues as he cut me down and put the problem immediately back on me. He had an answer ready for everything and didn't want to hear about my worries. I gave up with the conversation and ended it early. I've reached a new level of cynicism.

People who work in these call centres - who don't care the slightest about customers' concerns - don't even try to hide it anymore.

I've given up with call centre support.",1
"Frustrating - terrible coverage, slow &amp; frequent drop outs",As soon as my contract is over (in 6 months time) I am switching and never coming back! I switched from Three to Vodafone in June this year as I had no choice when Vodafone took over Three and my internet coverage and speed has been rubbish ever since. So frustrating trying to do any work or research using the internet. So unreliable.  I get so frustrated that I end up tethering internet from my mobile phone which is on Amaysim Prepaid $39 unlimited - even that gets better speed! And it's much better value! Vodafone you are rubbish! Never again! Please don't anyone else sign up with them on a contract.,1
Hope you don't want to talk on the phone,"Vodafone has the worst reception ever, i renewed my contract in 2011 with a nokia 97 mini being promised great network coverage, i have no coverage in my house or  work in the middle of toowoomba.what ever you do please spend the extra $ 20 a month and get a proper provider, Telstra,Optus.  Vodafone is the worst Phone provider i could imagine, the best thing i love is calling vodafone from my mobil outside my  house outside and they can not make out your call, plu.s they can't understand austrailian.",1
Poor quality netowrk,"I have been with Orange/Three/Vodafone since 1995, switching to Vodafone at the beginning of 2012 after they took over Three. I immediately experienced a dramatic fall off in call quality including frequent drop outs and reported very poor sound quality from call receivers. I left it a few months before raising these issues with Vodafone customer service (VCS) this week as I understood that they were upgrading their network and hoped that this would improve the service. This improvement did not happen. VCS suggested swapping SIM card with another phone /using 2G instead of 3G. This did not help. They said they would call me the next day to check progress. No call was received. I called them after two days to report. The call dropped out twice during our conversation. I  hve lost work because of this issue. VCS suggested I wait untill March 2013 when a new tower is due to be installed. This is too long to wait. I'm off to Telstra.  I live in Sydney's Inner West.

Very Poor Network",1
Not Happy,"Vodaphone? more like Voda-Fail! their coverage is just awful and they're not getting 4G until next year! The sales person lied to me to sign me up on a 2 year contract and when i expressed my dissatisfaction the other day, they emailed me a technical issue form to fill out. I will never re-sign with these guys againgood plansthe coverage, the lying service people",1
Wonderful Network,"I had been enduring terrible coverage, but little did I know it was my handset, not the phone. Upon switching to a Blackberry Curve 9360, I received 3G+ coverage everywhere. I now have better coverage than my friends on Telstra, and Optus. I was considering switching, but now I'm going to stay with Vodafone for the foreseeable future!reliable, inexpensive and great customer service",5
Wrong information on credit usage,"I have been with vodafone for more than 2 years. I never used data except about 10-20% in the beginning. However, I cautiously used almost all of the $180credit.  Usually, I used to check before my monthly time was up and then made few national and international call, based on how much was left on my credit. I had never in the past 24 months with this plan exceeded my $180 credit except maybe about $10 and that was just once.This month, I got a whopping $138 bill ! I was shaken because it was showing me till the end that it had still credit available on my $180 but now when i read the details, vodafone had already started to charge me 15 days before the end for the billing period. It never sent me a warning and moreover, it kept on showing me that I had credit remaining. I had no idea that it was charging me on background.
I think this is open cheating by vodafone. The customer service guy was kind enough to give me some discount on the extra amount but my question is why should i pay even a single penny extra if i was given wrong information by vodafone???
I am regretting that i stayed with vodafone for one more 2yr contract !!!
Good Bargain ! Better than optus !
Wrong Information and thus cheating on customer ! Of course, I have to run out of my room when the phone rings - looking for good reception !",1
Not happy with coverage,"poor coverage in my workplace CBD and on the train home. regular drop outs and unable to call at times. have been told on several ocassions that my home area is under going network upgrade, however the results have not changed and there is always more excuses when i call up. was offered a discount to my account fees for my troubles, however they did not follow through with this either. lot of broker promises and I am looking to switch right after this current contract.",2
terrible network,"Horrible network. Have rung service centre 8 times in a month. It seems like a part time job now. Cannot send msm. They're recon I have to turn off and on my phone if I want send a message. I believe this is the best expression of vodafone network services and my phone should have a ""quick"" on and off buttons to comply with the advanced network",1
BULL!!,"Hate it!It is the worst network out there!! Bad coverage everywhere!! On the train, in the house, on the bus and at the mcg!!! I only went for the good price for the phone i wanted. I love the phone but hate the internet and calls!! I once had a day when i could not call or use the internet on the train on the way home!! Think twice before signing a paper of hell!! I now have to wait until christmas 2013 to finish the contract!!!",1
Worst reception ever!,"I joined with vodaphone as they were offering a good deal with iPhones. I asked if I would receive coverage at a location about an hour from the city, as it's where I spend a lot of time. I was assured yes, absolutely, and was shown a map of practically full coverage of Australia except for very remote places. So I got my phone, and what do you know...nil reception at the location I specified. I called customer service once I got back to the city, and was told there was full service, but they would check and investigate to be sure. 2 weeks later, investigation complete- nil service out there. So I was offered to cease my contract, plus I could keep the new iPhone for free, which I did.

Terrible coverage, and I have since had much more luck with Telstra.
I got a free iPhone!
Everything. Customer service, coverage etc.",1
Great value plans,"Recently moved from three to Vodafonevand I was worried about coverage given their terrible reputation. I signed up for two years with a galaxy SII. They have a 30 day guarantee so you can make sure the reception is ok. Anyway, it's been fine. Internet, email, Facebook and of course phone calls work in the various suburbs of Melbourne I've been to. It might not be as speedy as some providers but a nice smartphone for $30 a month is a pretty good deal.reliable so far",4
Changed My Mind,"I was one of the below, who would rate Vodafone terrible because of the coverage issues in Sydney which seem to be caused by my Galaxy SII. I am now thinking they are trying to do much better on service. Spoke to 4 people in the last day and hung up with a smile on my face with all of them. I specifically noted a ""Kavita"" who dealt with 4 of my issues better than I could even count them.The people resolved all my issues with exceptional kindness and customer service skills..This must be why I'm still on Vodafone for 5 years in spite of the coverage issues.Good on you Vodafone Service team and I hope the network issues will be resolved soon as advised.Customer service, kindness, call back serviceNetwork issues",5
fair almost !,service is not bad except in some rare occasions service is not working and sms delaysalso internet sometimes plays up and rarely not working at all but its what you pay is what you getconsumer service mostly fine but sometimes is terrible and take ages to answer or follow upreasonable pricecostumer service,3
Worst company ever!,Vodafone and 3 are the worst companies I have ever had to deal with. Their nertwork is patherttic and their customer service is totally inept. After months of terrible coverage on 3 and being forced to migrate to vodafone (which was worse coverage) they finally agreed to allow me to cancel my service with no extra charges then when I cancelled they renegged on their advice and tried to charge me $2000 in cancellation charges. Never use these companies!,1
Network problam,This is the one of worst network which I ever used. I  will recommend to all that we should get rid of this network and go with Telstra . In the beginning of next yearmy contract will be finish and I will go with Telstra. One of the best network. Tnx,1
Never go to Vodafone,"Since we changed our internet connection to Vodafone we have lot of problems. It drops off all the time and we had to contact Vodafone about 5 or 6 times during last 3 months but problem stays still same. At the beginning Vodafone said sorry but sorry didn't change anything to our problem of internet connection or the slow connection speed. Now when we call the customer service, they even get rude and we've been told that we need to go to one of their stores with our computer and wifi, etc to explain our problem and that is what we have to do to resolve ""OUR"" problem. Our internet is very slow or drops off all the time but they are very quick to take out the money from our bank. They never forget or slow to do that. BIG no, no. Stay away.
At the beguining they at least said sorry.
We never had a problem with our previous internet connection since the day we changed to Vodafone, Problems... big mistake!!!!",1
Down with Vodafone!!!!,"I called three because i couldn't change my settings on the usb stick. They told me not to worry and they will guide me through it.n the net the starter pack said it was activated already which i thought was great, anyway turns out it wasn't activated and i had to call Vodafone to find out what was going on. The women asked me for the sim number and activated it and said it will take 30 mins to be active. 1 hour later i decided to try the internet and it was connected so i thought thank god, but then although it was connected there was no service so again i had to call vodafone! Spoke to a guy there and he explained that there is no service in my area for vodafone internet. 

At this time i wanted to shoot someone!!!! I became very assertive and explained my issue he apologized and i said thank you but really an apology was not enough. I requested to speak to the CEO because i want to know what he has to say about the company he is running and the service that being provided. The operator then put me onto his manager and i wasn't interested in listening to him, All he said was he was sorry blah blah blah i did tell him though i know its not your fault thats why i want to speak to the CEO. 

He took my number and said someone will call me from the dispute resolution centre tomorrow between 9.30 - 10am. I'm going to try my hardest to get to the CEO because he needs to know that this is what your customers think first hand!!! They have lost me as a customer and hope they lose more! Only then I hope they realise that its customers make its business!

",1
Do you have to give them 1 star??,"Vodafone are awful! It is the worst company with the worst products that don't work, the worst rigid procedures and the worst customer service ever! We have complained about the same thing 9 times (!) and they didn't do anything about it even though they told us so. How is that even possible?? Don't ever buy anything from them. Period.",1
Struggling for any positivity,"I was a happy 3mobile customer for prepaid broadband for over 3 years, up until one day ago. When the 3 network finally was taken over (Cannibalised) officially by Vodafone, my internet connection in my area went from first world standard, to third world in the 90's standard.Previously I had a prepaid phone service with Vodafone (in 2010), but after about 1 month of being screwed around with smses not sending or receiving, non existant reception and constant call dropouts, I changed to Optus and never really had any issues ever since then.Vodafone obviously is awful.I am an angry and non-returning customer.You have lost my trust and money forever!",1
Definitely the worse company I've had to deal with.,"I hate being a person to complain about companies on the internet but after my experience with Vodafone I think it's best to offer some advice to those looking for decent mobile providers.order the phone, and after a month I rang up to check up on the progress, only to be told that it was my fault, even though I called and went into my local Vodafone 3 times and made sure my name was on the waiting list. Any attempts to resolve these sorts of problems online are futile as their website is completely unfriendly to users and is always slow to load on both Internet Explorer and Firefox (I've emailied them about this problem, only to be met with a stock standard customer service reply that takes as much effort as a copy and paste on the keyboard).

The plans they offer are ridiculously expensive for the service they provide and their reception is always poor, particularly if you're like me and need decent reception for travelling to the rural areas of Victoria. 

I've dealt with a lot of mediocre companies in the past (believe me they're plenty out there!) but none of them compare to the utter junk pile that is Vodafail. Please do yourself and the world a favour by not giving this company anymore money.
Used to be better but now the market is more competitive.
Poor customer service, expensive, disorganized, poor reception",1
Fix My Bill,"I had been a loyal Vodafone customer for 10 years.I purchased a second service in October 2011. When my bill arrived, I found that Vodafone had in fact billed me for 2 new handsets, and 2 plans whilst only supplying 1 new handset and 1 new plan.When I contacted Vodafone, they asked me to fill in a Police report and send a Statutory Decleration so that a fraud investigation could take place. I did that and was suprised to find that nothing changed.I contacted them again every month until May when they suspended my service because I was not paying for their mistake. 
Eight months on, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman was contacted to help resolve the issue. Vodafone admitted they made a mistake, promised again to fix the problem but did nothing to correct the issue.
The matter has again been referred to the Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman. I am also seeking legal advise as Vodafone continue to bill me despite admitting their mistake. They are also continuing to bill me and now threatening to damage my credit rating.

Poor customer service",1
3G Fail - 3 mobile to Vodafone :(,"I have been a customer of 3 Mobile for years and have been fairly pleased with the phone service and mobile phone internet over that time. But then along comes Vodafone, I have been holding off signing up with vodafone even though I have been inundated with 'special' offers. Well last week 3 mobile changes over to Vodafone towers or whatever, OMG I have the slowest mobile internet ever, if any at times, absolute failure. Example, I was at the SCG on Saturday and could not get any internet on my phone (Iphone 4), wife had Telstra - no worries & friend had Optus - no worries. Well that is it for me, going to cancel and go elsewhere, bye bye.",1
Vodafone 3G is RUBBISH,I subscribed to 3 wireless broadband a 16 months ago and it worked OK until this month. Vodafone has taken over & changed the network and now it is absolute rubbish. If I Google anything it takes a minimum of one minute to refresh the page or times out. The service continually drops out and often need to make several attempts to connect to the service. The service is equivalent to dial-up modem of years gone by.,1
worst customer service ever,"Posting this here, because vodafone have advise me that i my post has been hidden from their facebook page  ""because it contains content that is against our Engagement Guidelines""e staff have been trained, they inquire why i require this information, when I indicate it is because I am leaving the network, all of a sudden the customer service agent is unable to help me and has to transfer me to another of their colleagues who apparently can - the retention staff.

Dont for one second believe that half the people on your network dont understand how a corporates host system works. Customer information is available to your frontline staff via a number of screens. Some staff have access to more information than others, however when one staff member says they can help you and then all of a sudden deny that they can looks plain stupid.

To get the end date of my contract I had to jump through a number of hoops for what was a simple question.

",1
Best Customer service anywhere,"A1 Customer service at every store i deal withNew network is amazing and super fast!Call centre has improved and gotten easier to deal with.Vodafone's new network is so good, i can't believe how much it has improved over the past year. So much better than its ever been, people complaining have no idea and are just going along with the so called bad karama. Its so much better for reception than that yes company thats for sure",5
Terrible.. Do not go with,"I was migrated from 3 Mobile to Vodafail and let me tell you i have never been so angry with service in my life.Poor reception, unbelievably slow 3g and thats when you can get 3g, late / delayed text messaged, inability to receive MMS messages.",1
Self? Service,"Apart from poor network coverage, dropouts, late sms texts, etc, etc, I have now needed to send my phone in to Vodafone's ""Service Centre"" for repair.  It came back with a service report that stated ""The handset software has been updated and the handset tested to ensure hat it is operating as per device specification"".  You guessed it... still faulty!  The phone would not turn on.   The shop tried everything and it was sent back to the service centre.  I decided to ring the service centre myself to let them know of my displeasure.  I was asked if i had charged the phone?  I said surely the service centre would have done this, how else could they have ""tested"" the phone as they said they did?.  Apparently not!  They send you a flat phone which you have to take home, charge for hours, then hope that it works, and if not take back to the shop again.  Go Figure .......

non existent service",1
Better than expected,"I actually was surprised by the level of service I received from vodafone. Some issues when rolling over from 3 (I was told by the three guy that I HAD to as they were shutting down the next week), but the vodafone guys handled them all, and I was given some discounts I hadn't been expecting at all.e vodafone guys at the Carindale store were actually sympathetic and tried all they could to get it to work, then suggested Fix My Phone around the corner. 3 hours later, one fixed phone and one very relieved owner were able to go about business as usual. Dick Smith is in the same complex and the guy there didn't even mention it.",4
Mobile broadband,"My 3 Wi-Fi Mobile broadband which I had for almost two years used to run very well and never had any major issues. However, since Vodafone has taken over the service has slowed down significantly and it is pretty much useless. I won't recommend to any one. I am starting to look around for alternative providers.FlexibilityVery slow almost dial in speeds.",2
Want some stress? Call VodafoneTechnical Support!,"Recently I was unable to receive SMS texts on my Vodafone/3 phone for over a week. I was told to call 13320 Technical Support to fix the problem. I have never ever experienced in my 55 years such appalling customer service and contempt for the customer. I had to make four separate calls to four different people and wasted over an hour and a half. Only on the third call was any customer record made. On two occasions I was not listened to:What was that Madam you can't send SMS? I was told at least seven times to turn my phone on and off and about five times to continually send texts to myself, as if I did that enough it would magically fix the problem. The third person I spoke two had an accent so bad I had great difficulty understanding what I he was saying. Only the last person I spoke to had a mastery of English good enough to use the polite forms of the language. As an ESL teacher I am aware that the majority of those who spoke to me did not have a command of English adequate enough to deal politely with my requests. This is appalling service by Vodafone and stressful for the people they employ.

poor English, did not listen, no customer history made",1
Stay Clear,Simply stay clear of it. Don't join or you will eventually be wasting your time and money. I would never wish what I get from Vodafone onto anybody. I've been following up to today on their upgrades but have given up. I've used the Vodafone network for over three years but will now be disconnecting it. It was absolutely rubbish.,1
Shocking service experience Vodafone Parramatta,"As you know, Vodafone offered to upgrade my handset to an iphone4 and I was advised one was on it's way in the mail. I was gien no further instructions about what to do when the phone arrived, other than to send my other phone back in a satchel. When the phone came, there was no manual. I have since been told that the manual uploads on the phone automatically, but in order to access that you need to choose a network. Vodafone was not on of the options that came up on the handset and so my flatmate and I attempted to inset the sim card suspecting that perhaps the network would come up, then, having to you-tube the instructions. The simcard I had was too large for the sim-car aperture on the iphone. Vodafone did not send us a replacement sim or indicate ot us that our current sim card would not work on an iphone.


To resolve these issues, I ended up taking my Saturday morning off and going to Vodafone Parramatta, Westfield, level 5.
 
On arriving, I was served by [name removed].

 

He advised me that I was supposed to have rung Vodafone (not bothering to check with me if they had advised me of that) and I was supposed to have advised them that the iphone had arrived, and he asked me if they had sent me a replacement SIM card. When I said I was not given any of these instructions nor a replacement sim, and that it concerned me that the call centre staff had not advised me of the procedure, he was dismissive, saying 'its fine, it'll only me take 5 seconds"". I said that it was not really fine as I had to take a morning off to travel by train to Parramatta and resolve this. He ignored me.

Shocking service experience Vodafone Parramatta,"Hi, everyone. The HEad Office took a keen interest and sorted out the Staff. However, due to a 'very rare' problem, which has happened repeatedly to me, my sim transfer which is supposed to take 4 hours, took a number of months. They compensated me.",1
Unexpected Bill,"I have been a customer with Vodafone for almost a year and never had a problem until last month when I opened my bill to $500+ worth of data charges. The month prior, my bill was $95 more than usual. I went to the store, they sent it to Billing and it was refunded with no explanation that it was from over data usage on my part. They also didn't tell me I can set-up an alert once you're going over your allotted amount. That would have been really helpful.from a consumer point of view. If I had know I could have set-up an alert, or known the extra fee was for data usage it would have been one thing but I'm quite shocked. Once my contract is finished I'm definitely switching carriers.",2
Warning lemon alert!,"After a year of persisting with Vodaphone, something has to be said. Vodaphone is categorically the worst carrier in the land. Lacks basic coverage around brisbane. Drop out is the norm, data hang on the iphone renders it useless. Vodaphone offers a diservice rather than a service. The indicated service coverage information provided is a gross misrepresentation compared to the frustrating reality.One of the most irritating thing among many is the thank you message I receive every month after paying my bill that reminds me just how much I am being ripped off. Stay away for vodaphone!
Vodaphone makes ""3"" look outstanding.
Teaches me infinite patience.

Useless customer service! bad signal and Overcharge!!!,"spent hours and hours try to talk in regards of my bill which ridiculously charge 5 times than normal bill. they kept saying I understand-I Understand, but clearly they dont understand at all! ever since im with Voda which is a year and half ago, i never have to pay bill more than my Cap. which i use it mostly for few personal call, texting and browsing internet. facebook is by far i can get into.. thats even sometime i can not get it posted due to lack of signal. and to be charge 5 times than ur normal bill, is absurd.. tried to speak to the management, unavailable. what kind of business where you dont have manager on duty to answer ur customer problem?? Unbelieve-able! bad signal, i can deal with it in tolerant. Bad signal and charge for something u dont even know belong to you or not, that's too much..!

bad signal, charge the wrong amount of bill, nothing to resolve even when you are try to speak to management level.",1
poor network and liers!,"Been on a 24 month contract where I was on a 35 a month plan.I was told that I could ring 0800 numbers ie job centre for free and which it states on directgov website,so as I was looking for worktrying to ring job centre the network constantly cutMe of mid convosation after waiting 20 mins to getthrough to speak to anyone.so I had to repeat the process a few times.then my bills come in the end of the month and was told the 0800 number wasn't free!.the advisorfrom vodafone wasnt helpful fatally and swore blind that all 0800 numbers charge so what about childline etc are they not free?.? Very misleading will never recommend or use again.",1
After a year i lost the signal.,"After a year i lost the signal,all i get is they are working on it ,i have to pay for a 3 dongle on top of my vodafone contract,ive phoned text email been to the shop even called trade standards,they want me to take them to court because all they say is i have got a signal,ive still got till after xmas to put up with this,i was taking my pc to town to get a signal they said i am using it so cant help,i dont understand why trade standards havent got involved.",1

No Issues,"I've been with Vodafone for about four or five months and never had an issue. I've only ever called to their customer service team once and spoke to a pleasant man located in Australia.The service isn't incredible in my area, although I've found that with all phone companies. I would recommend Vodafone to anyone as they've been great.I've never had a problem with the.",4
Good,"Its not the best and its not the worst. I have been with vodafone for 8 years now and am happy with their value for money. I dont mind sacrificing some reception for some extra useage. They have competitive deals and their call centre has good staff to deal with. Will certainly stay with themGood deals, value for money, friendly stafflack of coverage and lack of coming through with their upgrades when the say a time line, not the BEST deals on the market for all their products/services. You also dont get a discount for having internet and phone plans",4
Excellent,"I love how people come onto this site making racial comments and vilifying people you they do not even know. The bottom line is, in regards to ""I cant stand talking to an Indian"", is that companies outsource thier labour and please let me know of a few thousand Australians that would be happy enough to work in a call centre, servicing the whole of Australia dealing with people that are rude and inconsiderate especially if the decision does not go there own way. A majority of these people that work in the call centre are highly educated people that know thier stuff and there english is impecable IF YOUR LISTEN. There is such a demand for technology and people wanting the best, so of course there is going to be issues with reception how can someone blame a person thousands of kilometres away for this? People use your common sense and be rational! Also if a contract is given to you when you sign up, read the terms and conditions, and dont leave if you are not happy, a customer service representative is not there to spoon feed you!
Fantastic Serivice on all levels",5
It's alright so far,"I have just switched from Three to Vodafone. As I always hear shocking things about vodafone, I was prepared to face something like my phone does not connect to the network for days or signal keeps dropping etc.aints to Voda at all (for now at least)! However, I have not received my very first bill from voda yet, so I will wait and see if I am charged correctly for my cap plan and data. 

I figured that people seem to be unhappy with telco no matter which company they are with. And I don't have high expectation with telco customer service anyway.As long as the coverage is good for where I work/live and I don't get overcharged, it is good enough for me.
Great pricing, good coverage
Not sure yet. Hopefully I don't need to deal with customer service often.",4
Adequate for metro business fleets,"Our business has been with Vodafone for almost 6 years as we changed from Telstra prior.  Yes, coverage is not as good, but our small fleet of phones don't use 3G data services and only use voice services, mainly in metro areas it gives reasonable performance.  Monthly costs are far better value and we don't have many discrepancies like we did on a monthly basis with Telstra.Value for money and reliable billingMediocre network coverage",3
Vodafone the worst network ever,"When I first signed up with Vodafone I thought the allowance and price plan per month was great but how very wrong I was. They do not offer good value for the money as a network, they have lied to me about things before, there coverage is terrible, they are conners, and what really annoyed me about them was that I bought a pure signal box from them which cost me Â£150 pound (after they told me my signal was good where I was although it obviously was non existent and I shouldn't of had to buy the box in the first place) was when I finished my contract with them once I finally finished payments with them (thank god) they said I could sell my pure signal box on eBay because I did not need it no more and get some money back. So when I did and paid to post the box to someone who bought it from me and they received it, after they tried to connect there phone to it and when they phoned Vodafone to ask why they could not connect there phone to it and was told the box cannot be re-used it, i found out Vodafone had told me another lie after I purposely asked them whether someone else could use this box if I was to resell it. They obviously wanted someone else to buy another box to gain more money out of people and con them although they could of used mine as it was fine. Do not use Vodaphone not matter what!
Nothing at all
Everything. And you can never speak to someone you can understand. It's always a foreigner",1
Network outages are Vodafone's only feature,"Terrible. I have had a mobile phone for about 15 years, and the only time I have experienced network outages is with Vodafone. I am in the lower Hunter Valley, and the network has consistently gone down since I moved here. You get great reception when the network is actually working, but it is always breaking.e internet on phone. I have NO ability to communicate because I don't have a land line. There have been 3 outages in the past week, 3 days, 12 hours, and 24 hours. Not insignificant!!

I've had enough of them and have requested out of my contract, but they won't let me. They gave me some free months on my plan, but don't seem to understand that I don't want money - I want network coverage!!

I cannot stand Vodafone and I will never never go with them again. I will never recommend them to anyone.

Network Coverage. Customer Service. Customer Care",1
Had double rechage taken out!,"I pay extra for the use of data on my Prepaid mobile, and while using it this morning I run out of data, and it was taken out of my main phone recharge without me knowing. After all, these are always itemized separately, when you go to check your account.Why wasn't my data just disconnected instead of doing this?Is there something I missed in the small print, about this?",1
Signed for 3 contracts when relocating - Not 1 bar of service with 25kms,"Signed up for a 2 x 114 iphone caps and 1x49 broadband contact in September 2010 in Canberra. Advised moving to Central Queensland and got them to check out our new adress on the coverage checker. Came up with full coverage. Upon relocation we realised not 1 bar of service within 25kms. Had to sign with Telstra and still pay almost 300 per month with something we couldn't use. They flat out refused to terminate the contracts. This has been going on since October 2010 yes almost 2 years!!! Last week the TIO finally resolved and refunded our money. Shame on you Vodafone!

The dishonesty about the coverage, the flat out refusal to assist when they misled me, the time wasted, the rude customer service, the unhelpful and consistent ""its not our fault""",1
mobile internet......it feels like torture,"Been with Voda for longer than 10 yrs.....used to praise the company. Now I loath Voda....not a day goes by where I don't say ....""stupid Vodafone"". My ph is gr8, the plan is brilliant. The drop outs, the feeling of being on a home dial internet service is killing me. They cut ten dollars a month of my plan, the Indian call centre to me were helpful. But if you want that ""im going crazy feeling"" join Vodafone. The send you crazy and it doesn't cost much. Walked into a telsra shop 2 says ago, the first time I have considered leaving Vodafone in over 10yrs. If no improvement by march, I will take up the offer of cancelling my contract. 
I want the old Vodafone back.
Was cheap, got told about 13 numbers and 18 numbers not on plan
Killing me, literally sending me crazy with slow like a sick snail internet.",1
Bad customer service,"Hi, I explained about my new cap and what happening that time but she not listing me because I upgrade online cap that time not any one with me like bargain and same phone my friend bay near by vodafone store ans he got 29 cap + 6 AUD so he pay very less and i got 29 cap + 20 so I  pay much more so it is very unfair with who buy online store and after  that I discuss with customer care but she not trust me if that I have cooling period so I terminate contract and i requested please termination my contract she said me now you do not termination your contract if you do so pay contract termination fee.it is like cheat with online customer really I feel very bad but no any option now I advise do not buy online phone.",1
Ridiculous service!,"Joining vodaphone was the biggest mistake. Firstly there was hardly ever Network coverage. I couldn't ever get online to access data. I was paying a large amount of money every month and was being over charged! I called to complain and I was put through unprofessional customer service people who were amused by my anger and frustration. It took me two hours and fifteen minutes to get my point across and they still were handling me from one person to another especially when I originally demanded to speak to the head supervisor. They offered me 2 months where my bill is charged at 50% less and they wanted me to send my IPhone back to them so they can replace it. This is there scandal to keep customers tied up to them and there way to cover up their shit service. I wasn't happy with that and asked to cancel my contract. They said ok but I had to pay a cancellation fee. That really made me mad! 

Why should I pay a cancellation fee for a service that was not provided for? So I took it to the ombudsman... This made a big difference... They contacted us right away and demanding us to tell them watever we want to stay with their company! All we wanted was the promised network coverage, good customer service with people who understood and spoke ur own language and an honest company that didn't overcharge u. 

So point is: Don't make thebiggest mistake joining up even though some of their deals are reasonably good! 

Bad network coverage, bad customer service and over charged bills.",1
Vodafone wireless internet is under par,"My wireless internet in Adelaide sometimes works, but often it will not work at all, and often it is very slow and difficult to load pages.  I live just south of the city where coverage should be great.  I rang them once and they would not do anything.  They said next year from June it should be better.  It is worse than the 3 coverage was!Courteous efficient Indian technical staff.It doesn't usually work acceptably well and i have to use another SIM from Amaysim.",2
The worst company I have ever dealt with.,"I originally signed up with Orange CDMA many years ago.  No problems there.  Orange was taken over by Three Mobile.  No major issues.  Then.... Three bought out by Vodafone and everything turns to rubbish!  Now on Vodafone network, so signal is poor and Telstra roaming becomes exorbitantly expensive.  Purchased a data pack but they failed to apply it to my account and I was charged over $900 for data that should have been included.  Took the ombudsman to sort it out.  After all that the data pack still wasn't activated.  Once again, the ombudsman needed to sort it out.  Customer service over the phone are absolutely useless to the worst possible degree.  Even the most simple enquiries become needlessly complex and no-one on the phone is ever authorised or capable of fixing an issue.  Information received is inconsistent at best.  Even after being disconnected, I am fighting to get a correct bill.  Amounts owed vary by as much as $400 depending on who I talk to.  I've dealt with some poor systems in my time, but Vodafone sets a new low.  Avoid at all costs.
Staff at 3 Stores at least attempted to help, but were hamstrung by the Indian call centre.
Worst phone support ever experienced.  Ridiculously inflexible automated billing system.",1
Bad customer care service,I am chasing my final bill since december as i had 2 phones from vodafone. I disconnectef both because fo poor service in my area. I spent more  than one hours everyweek to sort it out but they really dont care.  I am still chasing this to sort it out as I already paid my all bills.,1
Absolute trash!,"I transferred to Vodafone from 3 a few months ago due to the 3 network closing down. Since the start of my contract I had nothing but problems. I wasn't able to complete one call during the life of my contract and the mobile Internet which I paid a lot of money for was never available. me about it. 

After 3 weeks I managed to contact one of the supervisors and after half an hour of explaining to him that I had lost a lot of money because of the contract, he eventually agreed to cancel it.   

After changing to Optus I had discovered that Vodafone have now blocked my number, so anyone on Vodafone cant contact me. Is that not just immature?

I have nothing good to say about Vodafone, they are a terrible company, with awful service, pathetic customer service and they will keep doing the same stuff to you every time you have a problem. I even had one of the lady's who works in my local Vodafone store tell me to report Vodafone to customer affairs.

Dodgy,Oh my god they always try to over bill even though you dont exceed the usage . Stay away from them please people ortherwise you don't know what you in to for . I recommend virgin mobile . They are much more reliable . Still paying off the bill from the vodafone since they over billing me since April last year,1
Where to complain,"Who's tried to speak with someone from Vodafone? Vodafone has everything tied up in a circle (everythings automated) so there's no opportunity to complain to anyone representing Vodafone...they don't want to know!ith Vodafine but I'll tell everyone I can about their lack of customer service, totally inapt adults they have working for them and to be ware of their dangerous counters. Is it any wonder they don't have a customer service department; they don't know the concept exists.

Everything from the conter to the staff.",1
Order cancelled twice!,"The two times of order were cancled by some reasons and all told to do onother order. but, it took very long time and utill the spicail time is over due. so i can get my phone and sevices.",1
Rubbish,Every time I call customer service I find that I have to escalate the call to a manager due to the fact that they do not clearly listen to my enquiry etc... Sometimes im on the phone for up to an hour. I'd much prefer to be able to call and have my enquiry listened to and dealt with in a timely manner,1
Vodafone! Shame!,"I joined Vodafone and the reception was so bad, I had to change networks. they would not release me from the contract, so I have had to pay it out.",1
Pathetic,"I'm so over issues with vodafail. Just had work problems because I wasn't receiving calls or texts for days. Have never had satisfaction when I've called their customer service for issues like this. When I've rung to see if there are messages on my voicemail, there were 2, and then 3 text messages from days before suddenly arrived. Something very wrong with their system.",1
Promises vs Reality,"Our business uses 2 iPhone 4s - one in Wollongong and one in Sydney. The Sydney one works well enough but I was promised that the signal strength would be fine in Wollongong (and my sales rep even had a local Gong guy drive to our house & check... or so he says), despite Vodafone's own coverage checker saying it hadn't been upgraded yet to the new equipment.any mountains or tall structures) and it drops out all the time. So don't believe what they say. It's all about getting you signed up and hoping that you forget about how bad it was in 24months.

Pretty disappointing really. I only gave them 3 stars because the phone works well in Sydney and the phone functionality is brilliant. My suggestion, as much as it pains me... pay the extra $$$ and go with Telstra mobile. The customer service is poor but the network will work.
Phones were great. Sydney signal strength much better than with Optus.
A bit pushy, over-confident sales guy. Too many empty promises.",3
Absolutely dismal,"I've been with Vodafone for a long time.  At one stage, its coverage was great; better than Telstra.  Now, it is absolutely terrible.  I hardly ever get through on a first attempt at a call.  I hardly ever receive a call without it dropping out.  Frequently people call me and it doesn't even go through.  I get text messages days after they were sent to me; and frequently can't send text messages.  My business relies on the phone, and i can't use it.  i have called Vodafone, who appear to get a lot of calls like mine.  They are offering me the chance to break my contract without penalty, but I have to pay for the phone.  I said I'd think about it, as I don't want to give them another cent, for I have wasted so much already.  

I would never recommend Vodafone to anyone ever again...",1
No Connectivity,"We have been with Vodafone for ages. They had great options and the part I like the most is the fact that international text messages are the same price, however, I would far rather pay for a text message that will be delivered! My word, Vodafone has rapidly gone down hill. I am due to upgrade & was told that I would not have signal issues with certain phones, due to the network upgrade...Samsung Galaxy S 2 being one of them. I was over my HTC Legend connectivity issues and would have upgrade to Samsung through vodafone, thank goodness I have had one to test!  What bullcrap! It works no better than my HTC, in fact it's probably even worse. My hubby had a work phone through Telstra and we had absolutely no issues with signal in our house! Vodafone, you [censored word deleted].  I would never recommend you ever!
Good price......but it would be, because you get what you pay for! Nothing!
No Signal, incompetant support, always playing the blame game, if they can't fix it, it is someone else! My text messages eventually go through, however having issues with one particular number!  Now it is the number, not their problem, yet I can text the number from another handset...but they can't give me an answer!  Seriously, when customer services phone as you are elligible for an upgrade and they keep getting disconnected, because there is no signal and I have never heard back from them.....you got to wonder why not!",1
"Terrible coverage, call centre hard to understand",Where should i start with vodafone? maybe the fact that i should never have signed up with them. It frustrates me though because they have the best plan deals out there and that's what wins the sale. Then you find out how terrible the coverage is and the call centre - i am not even going to start with that.,2
Poor Signal Strength Even on New 850 Network. Even the old 3 Telstra network was bettter,"Migrated from 3 to Vodafone and it was a nightmare. Could not call/text when you really need to because network was not available in CBD, in suburbs, in airports, in train stations - basically anywhere where you really need to use your phone. Worse still sometimes the call never came and the voice mail/sms arrived 2 days later. This being in a coverage zone where Vodafone claims the signal strength is good - wonder who comes up with such misleading coverage maps. The new 850 network is worse than 3 telstra. Atleast's 3 network allowed calls to come through although data speeds were not good. It is serious risk to be on Vodafone network because you will not be able to use your phone when you really need to.
Cost Effective if you are lucky to get better signal strength
poor signal strength even on new 850 network with compatible handsets. Unreliable - you will be lucky if someone is able to reach you or text you when you really need it.",1
Seriously terrible! No reception on south eastern areas in Melbourne,I wouldnâ€™t recommend anyone to go with Vodafone. Such a terrible reception! If you want to make a phone call you have to go to city. Because no signals in suburbs. Once I contacted them they said that we were in a black hole for their network. Good luck those who are with them!!,1
If you are thinking to go for Vodaafone think again,"Seriously if you are thinking to go for a new mobile never ever go for Vodafone, their service is terrible these days, Call drop, voice distortion and exceeded bills are common problems that you will have to pay at the end of the day, last month they added $80+ in my bill saying that I did that international call, well at that time I was on a night job and my mobile was with me, I live by myself and no one by any chance can make that call but they keep saying that I did that call therefore I will have to pay for that.worst mobile service everexceeded billing and call quality problems",1
Network drops out all the time,"Live in South Melbourne.While the pocket wifi modem always shows good reception and a connection, I'm very often not able to open any site. I assume it is network congestion. Called them and they checked all my computer settings. Then they admitted that it is the network and promised to fix something. Didn't happen and it's getting worse by the day.",1
currently with vodafone and my signal drops out almost all day!,I am currently with vodafone and my signal drops out almost all day. everyday.,1
Terrible,"I signed up with Vodafone 3 weeks ago on a $45 infinite plan. At the time I asked what the Vodafone service was like and if I would get good service at home. I was told that service at my home was in a normal service area and was told the overall service would be better as the system had just been upgraded. That was on a Saturday, everything seemed fine. Then on the Tuesday I had no service at home and it is still the same now. I emailed them about the problem and believe it or not I received a cut and paste answer about their service and that was it. I emailed them back and they denied and service problems. (BTW it takes up to 5 days for a response, does that tell you anything?) Then I decided to have a look on the net and do a search for ""Vodafone service problems"" and pages came up from everywhere. These problems have been going on for months now Australia wide and it seems everyone has been getting the same [censored word removed] response as I have. Don't even think about calling them unless you have at least an hour or 2 spare. I will be complaining to the TIO and asking them to cancel my contract. It seems from what I have read on the net, thousands of others have done the same. Maybe if they stopped putting so much money into race cars etc. they may be able to provide a decent service.
Absolutely Nothing. Do your homework before signing up with this company. Do not believe what they say in-store about their mobile phone reception.
Very poor reception, Customer Service Lie when you make a complaint.",1
Going Downhill,Vodafone used to be good when I started with them six years ago but now quite frankly they suck don't go there. Customer service is terrible you talk to someone in India who does not give a crap about your problem.,1
Good onya Vodafone :),"I have had Vodafone for over 10yrs now, I have never had an issue to comment with Vodafone, yet so many people complain. Really every single Telco have problems if they say they don't they are lying to you. I am never over charged, I use prepaid, I have internet and mobile prepaid, I don;t receive nasty bills, I can recharge when ever I want or not, completely up to me. I have 12months with the same number after each re charge. I have even received a free phone for no extra to what I do, just had to re-charge. I noticed on the TV people complaining about high bills, I say go prepaid, and yes Vodafone has a wide coverage area, I live far north in S/A, I never have bad range, yet many that call me do and they are in the city areas.

"Worst coverage, worst 3g internet speed. dodgy  coverage guarantee.Can't beat Telstra coverage!","I was with three which had little better reception than vodafone. I am going to get TPG which has even cheaper plan than Vodafone and has at least good coverage, because they use Telstra networks and Optus networks. I had TPG adsl 2+ before was great with speed and everything because they are using telstra land line. One bad point of TPG is bad customer service, however if get good reception and internet speed I don't care about customer service. I am going to get $34.99 plan which gives $1000 value, 3 gb internet 3g data, unlimited calls to TPG land line and tpg mobile numbers. Unlimited text all over the world.  No one can beat Telstra.3 months free service offer all the time.No coverage at all.",1
They dont even deserve a star,"Worst experience ever with hunger driven company that charges $180 on a $29 cap. Had no internet for 25 days of the month, hardly make any calls with this mobile...so please explain how you can charge such ridculous prices.

get a back up provider to cover vodafones lapses and network outages and problems.,"What a long road and only a few months left till the end of my contract. Have had a back up with alter carrier, OPTUS. That is how I am working now. When it hits a heavier time esp, there are no givens with vodafone. Its an old story but great till they merged with 3. Then months and months of upgrade promises..... I would rate vodafone the lowest in letting their cutomers down.great, when it works well!so much hope given and lots of disappointment in their promises of service.",2
Terrible,"It is NOT racist to say overseas service is not good enough, regardless of location, accent or local staff sensibilities.nce for the customer. And that means it's just plain wrong. And what about a phone company that simply refuses to call customers back!!

Now there is a sneakiness about service dealings too...I recently bought an HTC Legend and scheduled a 12 month payment to coincide with the end of my contract. Vodafone is billing me correctly for a 12 month payment but the paperwork sent out detailed a 24 month contract extension that I have only just noticed. It's too much of a stretch to believe this was an accident.

Similarly, when you pay your bill now, the payment doesn't show up for weeks at a time and it looks like you have bills outstanding, leading you to pay again. How hard can it really be to update payments in real time?

Vodafone has turned a history of surprise and delight into a policy of deliberate customer disservice.

Worst service including signing up,"They don't even deserve a single star.). So, I don't understand how I got rejected. I emailed them but there was no reply at all. This is ridiculous! I always get approved for all my credit card applications (never have I ever been rejected). Vodafone, a telco and not even a creditor or a lender, refuses to render their measly $40 mobile plan (+ cost of the iPhone). The only reason I would ever want to purchase the iPhone from them is their $100 trade-up bonus credits and nothing else. The way I look at this is that their promos are a sham such that when there are too many availing it, they would simply reject you. Nice try Vodafone!

Won't replace broken phone,Vodafone has failed me big time! Now i am just gathering docs before I file a proper complaint. You have a very poor costumer service both in store (been to 2 store) and over the phone. Nobody wants to bloody help me! Now I am stuck with a broken phone. It has been replaced after so much compaints and you have sent me another broken phone. I dont want to deal with you guys anymore. 9 years with you guys and this is how you treat your costumers.,1
Bad Service,Call them and email them many times and still not getting my prepaid active also they didn't even give a number waste $40 on prepaid i already a few emails and i call today and they hang up on me today im so annoyed so bad review and i want my money back now report you to the ACCC and now going dispute the transaction,1
Worst telecom service ever,Have waited over an hour (And counting) just to speak to tech support department. I amA new customer using the internet. Should have known after my iPhone 11 went missing in the post last year and took several months to replace (with the wrong colour).The screenshot says it all. Donâ€™t use this company. Bloody nightmare to deal with -the worst.,1
"Finally I can express my anger and disgust in this pathetic, incompetent, corporate criminal","Finally I have come to the right place to write about a service which should not be operating in Australia due to malpractice and defrauding it's customers. That company in none other than VODAFONE.Getting straight to the point, since joining Vodafone in 2008 and signing a contract for a Mobile Phone Service they have not delivered any of the Services outlined and which I was paying for over the 24 months during the contracted period.Calls would drop out even though full reception is displayed on the phone.Some areas in Sydney would not get any reception at all.
SMS messages took excessively long to reach the recipient, with some SMS messages going through 1week later.
What a Joke, this company must think that it''s customers are stupid. Unfortunately they are wrong and myself along with thousands of others have already pulled the pin on this company.
Vodafone is yet another corporate criminal which doen't even have local contact for Customer Service. Not only have they profited immensely from unethical and unreliable garbage services, they have the nerve to send my personal credentials offshore to another country, breaking all privacy laws imaginable, and claim that this is sustainable for their business. What a load of crap.
Nothing, Worst ever 24 months locked into a contract with pathetic and unreliable service.
Terrible Mobile reception, delayed SMS and MMS messages taking up to 1week to send, No local customer service.",1
"Continuous delayed SMSs, calls defaulting to voice mail and lack of service availability.","I have been with Vodafone for some 7 years via a Reseller who is a valued customer for the services provided by my company.  I have tolerated the call drop outs, the repeated effort to contact a client only to be left hanging on waiting for a connection etc.  Even though Vodafone continues to state it is spending large sums of money on improving its network I have not seen any improvement in the mobile service provided.ile reception locations mainly due to the large number of university student when the university is in session.  My business partner has in-laws that live in Kensington as well, he experiences the same difficulties that I do.

As stated earlier a key customer of my company is a Vodafone Reseller which precludes me from switching to another carrier; however this situation has recently changed as my customer has been purchased by a company that uses the Optus network.   After many years of suffering I am looking forward to the day that I can switch from Vodafone to Optus.

In the meantime whenever the subject of who provides a decent mobile phone service comes up, I am quick to point out my frustration with the Vodafone network. 

PS: This is the first time that I have used a public forum to express my utter dissatisfaction with Vodafone.

Continuous delayed SMSs, calls defaulting to voice mail and lack of service availability.",1
"Broken promises, very limited mobile coverage &amp; slow or no data access","Hi.I went under contract to Vodafone in around March 2011 as there was at the time an internet only offer a free handset, 3 months free access and a free skin on a HTC Desire for a 24 month contract.To date I have had very limited mobile coverage in areas Vodafone lists as having good coverage and have had constant call drop outs and variable data access. Also I am still waiting to receive my free 3 months of access.Vodafone has advised that they could not find any record of my free access entitlement (and that therefore I am ""not telling her the truth""). The Vodafone technical area did not resolve my problem with regards to call drop outs or limited/no coverage.
I now have a completely useless mobile which can only be used for occasional internet access, which is very slow.
Great handset - pity that I can't use it.
Do not provide an adequate service, do not deliver on offers and promises and some of their operators have poor customer relations skills.",1
Vodaphone Indian Call center tried to rip me off again!,"Firstly trying to change from 3 to Vodaphone has been a 3 month mission!They encouraged me to keep my contract and agreed to after much hesitation as I wanted to help out a friend with the ""loyal customer"" reward.I agreed and said I would have to change my number so that my friend doesnâ€™t get calls from old connections, being a bother. Vodaphone said no problem, itâ€™s going to be free as its your first number change.Well today they wanted to charge me $19.95! My teeth started to grind once more.After informing my Indian customer service person that in previous conversations, your colleagues said 2 months ago that it would be free. I mentioned that seeing calls are recorded I would like to retrieve my conversations I had with Vodaphone and prove my case.

Immediately she said Ã–K! Pick a number, and gave me a choice of 5 number to choose from, for free!

Recording telephone conversations for training and quality purposes does sometimes come in handy:)

Slow and poor service,"Overall the coverage and signals are not that bad. The real let down is how slow Vodafone manages to port numbers from a different server. For both my husband and I it took over 2 weeks and 19 phone calls to get it working. I do not blame the call center workers, I in fact feel sad that they work for such a bad company. Their system is very slow and it is a shame.Coverage is ok, they have good capsReally slow service",2
Worst mobile network ever used.,The following is based on my personal experience with voda.,1
Vodafail!,"I have been trying to get information/service with regards to a plan I've just signed up with. I have tried calling them, using their online services (and I use the term ""service"" loosely) as well as in person at one of their shops, all to NO AVAIL. The two issues I was trying to get help with were 1) changing my address that was from 4 years ago and was in a completely different state 2) to find out where my new phone was that I had ordered and received no notification of how long it would take to deliver or any email confirmation of my payment, nor did I get a tracking number (even though immediately after paying with my credit card, it took me to a page that asked for this fictitious tracking number). 

On the phone, I was put on hold for 45 minutes after the automated voice told me it would be a 4-minute wait. I was then informed that the query I had was meant to go to another dept so the person on the other line put me on hold to redirect my call. I waited another half hour before I just got so pissed-off I hung up. I then went through their callback system to get another useless operator (who is clearly aware that there are no consequences for crap customer service) who then told me he's going to put me on hold to re-direct my call. I was too angry to wait again so I told him I refuse to wait another hour to have either of my issues addressed. I told him I wanted to cancel the plan. He said he'll have to re-direct my call. What exactly is the point in calling the ""help"" line, if when you do, there is NO HELP on the other end, just redirecting?

I then tried to log-in online.  Again, instead of being redirected by a person, I was 'redirected' to pages that either timed out or just didn't load. I was going through their ""helpful"" tips because I thought I might be doing something wrong.  I'm in IT so I'm not unfamiliar with navigating through sites. Their site it just completely UNHELPFUL and too cluttered to manoeuvre through. I feel this is a deliberate tactic to confuse the consumer. There are loads of sections that are similarly named but with different information. Completely useless to garner any sort of helpful information.

I then tried to go into the shop only to be left waiting in line, to get a ticket to wait in yet another queue. This is the sort of business practice their executives think is going to get them more clients?  

I think everyone who has had an issue with Vodafone needs to post their discontent on every social media site possible. This is unacceptable as well as unethical business practice. I'm fairly shocked at the rapid decline of their service since they merged with Three. I am also going to be posting on travel sites that all travellers and expats should avoid using Vodafone in Australia (regardless of what their experiences were in other countries, because mine in the UK was ok). Regardless of how appealing it sounds, it's all a ploy to steal your hard earned money and ruin your day if you ever have the misfortune of having to call them for any assistance.

Vodafone is fine if you have a simple mobile Eg. a $20 one,"Honestly I have a HTC legend and Vodafone is fine for making calls and texts but if you have a smart phone (iphone, HTC) then don't use vodafone the internet is absolutely crap, constantly drops out and is very unreliable, it especially sucks when you need help with your phone and you ring 1555 then you have to try to work out what Indians are saying on the phone because they are so bloody hard to understand half the timegood if you live very close to the city and dont have a smart phoneonly $20 Phones work properly on vodafail",1
Cheap and not reliable,The best part about this mob is if the phone dont work the bill stays lowThis is a blessing when you are paying for your childs phoneBUT I would not use them myself TOO unreliablevery cheapdrops out alot and its not reliable,3
Worst reception.3G runs at 1950s internet speed! Beats the basic purpose of a mobile phone,"I should have checked here before I went for vodafone. Reception is very bad and I might be lucky to finish a call(with breakups inbetween) if I stand outside my house.toyota would ask you to buy an alternate car ""just in case..you know""

Never go for a plan even if they give it away for free..you might not be able to make that emergency call or receive one when you need it the most!

bad support, bad network, waste of time and money",1
Three Vodaphone,Very disappointed with Vodaphone. Contract terms changed mid contract with no warning. I had a 3G bonus download on my internet which was stopped after 10 months into new term. Impossible to talk to people in Indian call centre. Internet regularly drops out and this did not happen with Three before the merger. Calls regularly drop out. Not happy.,1
"A lousy network , in a field with very poor competitors","Worst decision I made was to move to Vodafone, primarily because their network coverage is basically rubbish. Can't even get one bar on the tram going down Lygon street in Melbourne! Just about everywhere I go, the phone drops out, while my 12 year olds child's Amaysim prepaid works fine. Don't touch this mob, despite the promises they make.",1
Unreliable billings &amp; unexpected charges,"My first month bill was A$659 overdue.I joined Vodafone for less than 2 months now. I have been checking my usage through Vodafone website avery second day. On 31/1/2012 I still had $365 left in my plan, but 2 days after on 2/2/12 I was $659 overdue! I have been on the phone talking to Vodafone customer care almost every day. They say they had system difficulty and were not able to update their costumers' usage for up to 5 days (which I think was even more than that). They are not helpful and not understanding. I am looking to buy a plan for my wife but not with Vodafone for sure. Some of my other friends had similar problems but with less charges. I won't recommend it at all.

Poor customer care, unreliable provider, not able to track your usage, not understanding their faults and reluctant to help.",1
After a while help finally came,"i was having a problem with my Nokia N8 phone - i was with vodafone for my provider, and had to return the phone twice now in order for the phone to be replaced, which is finally being done.. Vodafone were taking out unauthorised money out of my account which was finally reimbursed  - we have been up to the vodafone store about 10 or so times picking up phones etc.. receiving false messages about he phone needing to be picked up when it wasnt even at the store.  All in all we had to go through two managers and the ombudsman who helped us immensly.  So moral of this story if they cant help, go to the higher powerthey finally replaced the phones with Samsung galaxyreally bad service at the shops",3
Useless bunch,"Always billing me wrong, overcharging and not providing the service they promise. Cant even use the service I pay for in the middle of the CBD. Not worth the hassle and strongly urge anyone considering Vodafone to think again.",1
bad cust service,"Asking about the details of my bills (as to how to read the bills). my call was taken by someone named [name removed],at about 3pm, 23/2/2012, who spent 10mins just trying to give me answer, during which he left me on hold most of the time. I called the billing department, so im quite surprise the staff is not well informed about the billing details n structure.Last qns was about the ""spend this cycle"" which took him another 3mins to understand what is that. which apparently is "" a charge incurred in this plan that is not included in my contract"" I found it out myself and told him that. then when he told me it's a charges that I make when I dialed 123numbers, I asked him when did I do that because I never used such service. He said he cant answer me because he can't see it in my billing usage. (they why is it there?) and he said I just have to wait until the bill is issued.
I asked him again how come the charge is there if neither he nor I can't find it in the billing usage. He started to raise his voice.. wow...so I raised mine to match him..and to calm him down.
bottom line is, I wonder how vodafone trains their staff, 10 mins just to get an answer about my bill details (most of the time spent on hold) is ineffective. and what about charging me something but unable to explain and point out which calls incurred that charges. with the only suggestion: please wait until you receive your bill. 
Will escalate this to ombudsman for sure. 
Everyone should do that!!

bad attitude, bad service, bad signals",1
No service - Cuts out mid call and unlimited cap ...not so,"Grr very cross , my unlimited cap came with a 200 dollar bill for checking voicemails ....Had to upgrade again ....No service in key spots ...Seriously improve your act vodafone ...Not happyPoor serviceWhat happended to the old vodafone ?",1

Bad Reception AND Bad Service,My mind has been made up over the weekend to end my time with Vodafone after 3 long years with them.I'm on the $49 pre paid cap and although yes you do get alot of call credit and extra credit if you buy your top up from places such as Woolworths or Coles Express service stations.But the drop outs in reception are just so bad now. Right now I am in a location where the phone tower is less than 5km away and I have 1 bar of reception!,1
Worst coverage ever!,I have been on vodafone mobile broadband for three years now and their connection sucks. Every five minutes it says theres no network available. WTF? I get disconnected a 100 times a day. Isnt it time you people do something to fix it? Seriously this is ridiculous.Cheap but not worth it,1

At an awful time of my life Vodafone made things even worse,"My dad has recently passed away. Prior to losing him my opinion of Vodafone was already negative. Virtually as soon as I lost my dad, Vodafone network coverage for me has become much worse. Very Very annoying when trying to contact friends and family at a difficult time in my life. I will always remember Dad and I will always remember Vodafone. By the way, they make it very difficult to contact them or make a complaint. Their service on a whole is rubbish. You would have more success with 2 cans and a length of string.  I am going back to Telstra.  Telstra have many faults also but at least their coverage is better.",1
horrible customer service centre.,"Working in a call centre myself, I know whats acceptable and whats not.Vodafone customer servoice representatives are hopeless. you get the run around like i have... dont waste you time like i did. go directly to the ombudsman and let them know what sort of issues you are having.
with in 2 days, someone who works here in Australia will call you and help resolve the issue.",1
Not too bad,"Vodafone is great for having the latest phones but, I must say, their customer service is not so good. Customers that are looking to give vodafone a chance, you should see some phone reviews first.",4
poor no very poor.............,nothing to write as it is hopeless case i think..........they r unable to provide network in the cbd area.cald them many times to know if problem is on our end but finally they admitted that it is network congestion problem.....dont know what to do.......my 5 yrs old son is unable to do even homework.......i donot know why vfone is distributing connection if they cant handle them..... think before u go 4 vfone.....,1
The worst service I have ever received - consistently,"I never really understood the importance of service until I consistently and over a long period of time received appalling  service. If I could shout from the mountain tops 'run like  hell' I would. I would never, ever, ever give them 5c more of my money. Ever.",1
I'm not sure if I would even give WhatdaFail with the minimum one star...,"When someone tries to call me, they would:ky, to reach me;
6. The next day I would then receive my voicemail notification from yesterday;
7. Then you would feel like wasting at least an hour every two three days and talk to someone from India on their call centre, who would say the issue has been resolved. Ten months later, same story applies.

Appauling,"i brought an iPhone 4s, and i was told it will be delivered in 5 days. I rang them up and they had no stock, i have now been waiting 3 weeks and they still have no idea what going on. I recommend telstra, great service  and nice people. Never go with Vodafone.Inexpensive",1
Don't ever go near Vodafone,I was told to go to the local post office to pick up the handset because no one was home where as a matter of fact someone is always home.....then I found out the phone was defective...every phone call with their customer care took hours of holding. And I give up...stay away from VodaFone.,1
Excellent,"I think Vodafone is the best network on the current market. It has a good network coverage, It has a lot of really great offers in terms of credit plans where they add a lot of extra credit for free. I also think they have the best range of phones and a really good customer service team.Great customer service, great range of value caps for people on pre paid plans and also a massive range of Vodafone branded phones that are very low priced and good quality.Their website i found it really hard to use and confusing i also have to say that setting up my pre paid sim was so hard and complicated in comparison to the other networks.",5
Such poor communication!,"Going from 3 to Vodafone was supposed to be a breeze! It wasn't and my business depends on it! My new sim card wouldn't work and it wasn't until I got desperate and called Nokia that I got to speak to a real person albeit someone overseas. They explained that I had to get 3 to ""unlock"" my phone, not easy on a Friday night. With the help of ""real"" people the deed was done. My gripe is, why can't we be forewarned? I doubt that I'd have such a sour taste in my mouth regarding both 3 and Vodafone [Aren't they supposed to be the same company now?]if I'd know in advance what to expect.Coverage is goodJust the initial transition",2
Voda Big Fail,"I have been a vodafone customer since November 2010. I have been into a store weekly since then trying to have my problems with either their system or my phone fixed.t was found and fixed. 

The phone I was using whilst on contract was a nokia N8, which I had returned for repair, and eventually replaced, which the replacement lasted 30 minutes before I found a fault with it and asked to pick a whole new handset, to which they agreed.

I then upgraded to an iPhone4 and since then my service has hit rock bottom, my reception is patchy at best and calls arent coming through etc. Vodafones solution to this is to switch me to a new sim card, which has had little effect. I have had apple replace my phone, which was vodafones idea, but still no luck. 

I am currently under monthly subsidy of my cap charges and for the next 3 months and are compiling a list of places and times my iPhone loses reception. I will be disconnecting my service with them once the 3 months are up, as 3 times in the past 2 weeks my new iPhone4 has lost all reception.
International Inclusions, Cheap Handsets
What was right with it???",2
Don't go with Vodafone until you've read this!,"I cancelled my contract because of a series of mistakes by Vodafone such as not updating new credit card details or address, double charging my credit card and never refunding hundreds of dollars owed to me due to the double charge, even after promising to refund time and time again etc. After cancelling my account, it gets worse. I find they've continued to charge bills incorrectly and as they are unpaid (because I had cancelled the account years ago) sent me to the debt collectors with no notification/s and now I've ended up with a bad credit rating! Don't go with Vodafone unless you want years (5 years to be exact) of headaches trying to rectify their errors, a company that ignores your emails and requests and a bad credit rating because of their constant errors! Vodafone should not be allowed to trade. Now I'm in the battle to have this bad credit rating removed as I cannot get any loans because of Vodafone's continuous stuff-ups - wish me luck!

Ended up with a bad credit rating due to Vodafone's many many errors!",1
Coverage sucks. Support sucks. Go with someone better!,"Been with their infinite plan for a few weeks and it's the worst choice even. Don't waste your money.""re-routing"" is to anyone not on the Vodaphone plan don't waste your money!!
The cost. 
The Coverage, the plan is not really infinite,",1
Horrible service!,"It's amazing that I was so loyal to this company. For five years I remianed on contracts with them, yet at no time did their customer service reach a level of acceptability. In my last 12 months with them I was spending over $250 a month (business contract plus personal internet) and on the numerous times I had issues and thought they might care, I was put through the ringer and treated like a dog to get (in the end) nowhere.e, their automated phone system makes it hard to get specific departments and their number one trick is to hang up on you mid-conversation. 

I actually can't stand this company. Horrible horrible service.
I guess their branding is kinda cool. 
Everything. Their new TV ad with Michael Clarke is an embarrassment to cricket and Australia.",1
Vodadfone is the worst experience I have ever had!!!!,"Vodadfone is the worst experience I have ever had!!!! They never respond to you if you have a problem. Their Customer Support is terrible!

Don't go with Vodafone!

Disgusting service - non-existent network coverage - very slow internet",1
Worst support line,"I have experienced bad customer service from their 24/7 help line for a very long time. I finally made the move to another network 2 months ago - Telstra $49 cap has been perfect. I received a letter from vodafone that my account is in credit. I tried calling them and I am talking to their pre-recorded machine that goes around in circles. After 40 minutes trying (3 seperate phone calls) I finally got through to i'm assuming an indian call centre, the phone call ended as soon as I said hello.",1
"""Customer Service"" Hung up on me","After sending my phone to wrong address and having to drive an hour to pick it up - a week late - I was told the phone would be activated after 3 hours (after another 30 mins on hold). The following morning I called to find out why it was not activated and was told by a sullen customer service rep to use my 3 sim? I have never had a 3 sim. She told me there were network problems (perhaps they could have warned me the night before) and the service will be working in 6 hours. No rhyme nor reason to this figure, it sounded like she was just trying to get rid of me. I tried to get a committed time frame by threatening to cancel my contract if it wasn't working in 6 hours to which she replied ""Fine, OK, bye."" And hung up on me!

Way to handle paying customers vodafone. I haven't even been able to use my phone yet after nearly two weeks and you've really got under my skin.

Being passed about departments repeating yourself each time. Sitting on hold for best part of 30 mins at a time. Rude/Dumb representatives.",1
Horrible everything,"We cancelled our Vodafone numbers 2 months ago, because their reception and coverage is horrible. We even suggest to pay out the contracts (to which they gave us the wrong amount and adjusted the amount over the phone) and we thought the nightmare was over.mes, my mobile number 5 times, my request 5 times. 

By the 5th time I've spoken to their prepaid department, business department and two other departments that I couldn't even make the names of. When they put me through to the prepaid account department AGAIN, I'm frustrated I asked ""why have you put me through to the prepaid department again?"" and the lady just literally blabbered a whole string of things that I cannot even make up the words to.

In frustration I eventually hung up on them as they haven't even started trying to resolve my problems after 15 minutes.

Horrible customer service, no central database recording information I've already given them, poor reception and limited coverage was the reason for the cancellation of contracts with them.",1
Vodafone cant provide service. Avoid Vodafone at all costs,I spoke to 17 people from diferent diferent nations over 7 days trying to get service on a i phone and i was not able to get it conected after making a phone contract 9 days ago. Will be calling the Ombedsman. Avoid Vodafone at all costsNOTHING hopfully going to another network if i can get outVodafone took 4 days to actavate one phone and after 7 the second phone was still withought service,1
The service that vodafone provides is any thing but! A waste of time and Money!!!!!,"My experience with vodafone has been terrible. I find it hard to believe a company like vodafone can still be in business.From having my phone cut off after only a few days of my bill being over due to paying for insurance the is miss leading and a waste of money. It has been one thing after another.Above some one wrote about receiving 3 months free due to bad service, i to have had 3 months for what vfone calls free...... 1st month was $20 and the second $30, god knows im not hanging around to find out what my 3rd free month will cost me.

Trying to communicate with staff that have poor English skills and spending hours being shuffled from one person to the next is just not on, If i had charged my time out vodafone would be paying me.....
I strongly urge any one thinking of signing up with vodafone to seriously reconsider, the prices are not overly competitive and the service is a shocker.
All so be aware of their insurance, i paid $10 a month to be told that a $150 excess is required to receive not a new phone but a done up second hander...... Not good enough.... To top it off you are only covered for accident or loss so that means if your phone just stops working or your battery will no longer hold a charge you are not covered!!!! 
Shame on you Voda, SHAME!
Not much, free vodafone to vodafone is about all they have to offer!
Bad insurance, bad network cover, bad customer service and no integrity! Waste of time!!!!",1
Absolutely Abismal,"I was on a plan which gave me credit and data. Everytime i went on the net it started eating into my credit not my data. I rang vodafone. It took me 40 mins to get through, they then transferred me to someone else. Another 20 mins and they HUNG UP ON ME. Called back, on hold 20mins and hung up on again!. Called back a third time was again transferred when I finally even got through. When I rang this time it was 4pm after sitting on the phone for 2 and a half hours I started to think they had all gone home and left me on hold running up my phone bill! After spending approximately 5 and a half hours on the phone trying to get through to them all day I ended up hanging up! I have never before experienced such insufferable service! I have since changed to prepaid Telstra who set up my new phone in less than 10mins and haven't had a problem.

I rang them again complaining about poor reception ,call dropouts etc. and they offered me another 3 months free!3months free access!bad coverage, slow internet, call dropouts.",3
Reason behind Vodaphone's cheap plans.,"The reason for their cheap plans is because their service is so bad, even in a CBD areas that they con you in with cheap deals and their ""competative"" rates.",1
Do not sign up with them see vodafail.com.au for more info.,"I resigned with vodafone in November on a $19 plan (reverting to $29 after a year). I never go near my allowed usage. They have been charging between $39 and $79 a month. I have tried many times to get through to india to sort this out only to be on hold for hours on end. I got through once and they transfered me to a dead line. I live only 6km from Sydney CBD yet often have no reception.I am going to the ombudsmen now to try and get out of this hopless plan and stop the rip off. Will be returning to Telstra asap.I would never reccomend them. Vodafone don't even deserve 0 stars but I have to give 1.
See vodafail.com.au for more information and STAY AWAY FROM THEM.
Looks like a great deal. 
NO service. Over charging. Very little coverage.",1
Poor network coverage,"I agree with the other reviewers who have complained about Vodafone's poor network coverage. I was a happy user of Vodafone between 2005-2009, but then in the past year or so found that frequently, my calls would just drop out. This was really annoying when they were professional phone calls and I then had to call back and explain the problem - sometimes repeatedly, as the calls would repeatedly cut out. So I ended up switching providers and would be very hesitant to ever return to Vodafone.one had good deals for plans, but if you can't rely on reasonable network coverage, then any contract with Vodafone is going to feel like a horrible trap - not a good deal!!!
Good value caps
Bad and unreliable network coverage",1
Don't trust them at all...,The team vodafone and three i would request you...Don't waste money on advertising your phones & plans..Try to spend little bit of money on improving your network.,1
great,i have been with vodafone for a while now after trying other services i have found that vodafone offer the best pay as you go rates and i love it. I get free calls to my wife and to my mum as they are on vodafone too they have fantastic caps where you pay $29 and you get over $150 worth of free calls and texts and then you get free calls to anyone on vodafone which is great for me as nearly the whole family are on vodafone. I have never had a problem with anyone in customer service and the people in the store are friendly and helpful and there home brand vodafone phones are great too.great value,5
Terrible,"Everything was dandy until the last two months of my 24 month contract was nearly up, then vodafone hit me with a $909.18 bill - credit where credit is due, every bill I had up until this point for the last 22 months was never far over my fixed cap of $49.00 per month.However in my latest bill, I went over my quota of fixed credit per month and as such I used 228mbs of data excess.The 228mbs of data alone has cost me exactly $826.53,GST on top of that comes to $82.65 making my bill for one month of use exactly $909.18 . Vodafone insist that this amount that I owe them is right.
Since recieving this bill from vodafone I have switched to an optus $49.00 byo cap plan that includes 1.5gbs of data and $500.00 credit per month upgraded to $650.00 credit per month for atleast 6 months and free sms too.
It does not take much working out which carrier to go for.
It is certainly not vodafone. 

I travel around Australia every week and I can say from experience that vodafone has very poor coverage in the country areas, average in the city and poor in the suburbs.  to be fair though, I have found that vodafone`s data access is a bit quicker than optus if you like to web surf.
All up I give vodafone 0 stars.

Terrible,"I have been with Vodafone for the past three years and have experienced endless problems.nt important emails and needed to receive them on my phone but they never arrived (I know they were sent because I was later able to check my computer).  Nobody was able to offer me a solution to the latter problem so when I upgraded to a new phone I hoped that the problem would be resolved but, no, it continues.  The people who sold me both phones don't seem to have any idea why and I had become convinced that this must be a problem peculiar only to me.  My husband uses the same Blackberry as I do but he has never had this problem - but his phone is connected to Telstra.

I was somewhat relieved to receive a letter this week from Vodafone's CEO apologising for their ongoing problems in multiple areas.  I now believe that my email problem is most likely related to the Vodafone network.
Great plans for Blackberry users.  For $70/month I get unrestricted internet access and more phone credit than I can use.  Great pre-paid options.  My kids only have phones for emergency calls and Vodafone offer a 365 day prepaid plan which is great for that type of usage.
Not much point having all that credit when you can't get any phone reception to make a call.  I try to use my mobile at home, given that I have so much credit, rather than my landline but I just can't get decent reception.  I have looked up the Vodafone website to view the coverage in my area and apparently it is very good?!?!?  My kids are with Vodafone (for reasons mentioned above) but I am moving them to another network.  What is the point of having a phone for emergency use if they can't get any phone receptioni when they most need it!?  I have had to pay $25 to unlock my son's phone from the Vodafone network but I would rather pay the $25 than have him stay with Vodafone.",1
Bad,"I know Vodafone is trying to make thir infrastructure better and i believe it will happen. They have too many customers online which is putting stress on their infrastructure.n Westfield customer service is very poor and their presentation is discraceful, , regionally the signal stregnth is poor. No reception in point cook - 15 minutes from melbourne and in Geelong i have at times one bar reception, c'mon geelong is a fairly big city..

Writing this review while on hold with Vodafone, i have been on hold for 32 minutes.

Bad,"I've never had any real issue with Vodafone, however, this episode has frustrated the [censored word removed] out of me to the point of Seinfeld 'serenity now' insanity. After voda initiating a sale with me and offering to 'deliver' me extra value, its safe to say that this whole interaction has created negative value. They would have been better off never calling me in the first place.It seems to me that many of Voda's problems stem from poor systems integration. As an existing customer, I was called by a Vodafone sales rep a few weeks ago and offered a plan update. They offered me the new HTC Desire HD on a $49 cap. I said 'great, let's do it'. They checked my address. They had my old residential address in their system so I mentioned that that was my old address and I didn't live there anymore. So I  specifically asked for the device to be sent to my work address. A week later I called to ask where my phone was. It turns out that they did not listen to my request. They did not delete my old address and actually sent it there. My phone is currently sitting at a post office in woop woop and they want me to go pick if up...
I think customer service staff need to get creative about how to solve problems. I know it's not their fault of the original stuff up, but please, get creative in solving problems. They can't possibly expect me to spend time and energy fixing their stuff up. 
They still haven't delivered my phone.",2
Terrible,"I have been having ridiculus problems for the last month and so annoyed.It started with wanting to order and upgrade my phone to iphone 4 as I can not get in store, they kept on giving me excuses there was errors on my account and they can not fix it and will have to get another team to fix it but they can not talk to them directly and solve it on the spot (absolute [censored word removed]) 2 weeks later and at least 10-15 phone calls (i made not them calling me)it still was not resolved or ordered so I cancelled the order.Then oh my god I rang up to de-activate my voicemail and turn on roaming and I arrived overseas with no roaming on, I then called their international contact number to wait 30mins to be hung up on they didn't even attempt to call back on my husbands phone. I then sent my sister in store to help and still no roaming! What the [censored word removed] Do not touch vodafone even if they are cheaper it is not worth it.
none there is nothing good about them
The service team can not communicate between each other, especially annoying as you can not resolve error issues. They tell you they will call you back when they work next not when convenient to you and do not call.
Terrible service if you can call it service",1
Terrible,"There is a bit of media coverage about consumer group taking the company to Consumer Protection Agency of some sort and I am not surprised. Seriously need to improve their services. I implore customers to just sign up for Telstra or Optus.Cheaper to sign up than Optus or Telstra but not by much...Those who have heard of the website Vodafail.com will know all too well the turmoil this company is in. There is wideranging excessive customer dissatisfaction with this service provider. I was stupid enough not to know and have signed on for a two year contract just 2 weeks ago. I have been with Optus and 3 for a total of 10 years now but Vodaphone simply is shockly the worst. Call drop out rate is so high that it often takes 3 calls to finish a 5-10 minute conversations, you phone is resting on a table with 4 signal bars yet it will beep to let you know that your have voice mails meaning calls didn't come through. Webbrowsing with Smartphones via Vodaphone are so unreliable that it will frustrate endlessly. They really need to do something or they will lose all their customer base. I called the company to ask some questions about my plan and I had to wait for 40 minutes and just give up. Literally...",1
Terrible,"Absolutely rubbish, paying for a service I'm not receiving.  On top of that I can't put into words how completely anoying it is to hear those 3 beeps and see 'call failed' or to realise your talking to no one because your called dropped out AGAIN!It's relatively easy to contact Vodafone and speak to a person.Connection constantly drops out, it can take up to 5 attemps to finish a 2 minute conversation! Often can't make calls 'call failed' comes up at least 2 or 3 times a day.",1
Terrible,"Let me ask you champ, is Vodafone still invoicing it's customers for a service?Would you still regularly pay for a service that you intermittently receive?None, don't do it.Crappy network, horrible customer service.",1
Terrible,"We don't use them anymore even if they have good product :( Thanks to Internet and Product Reviews...it gives us freedom to express what a real marketing is all about.The service was great in the past that's why we've been with them for a bit long UNTIL...We agree the service is [censored word removed] to us customers. They could NOT be bothered to listen to your problem with their service anymore after we paid them online to unlock our mobile phone. They don't want to refund your money that we paid for ""unlock code"" that is not working! I call that really [censored word removed]! The time we will post our phone to be unlocked somewhere in Australia after that unresolved issue with Vodafone could already buy us a new unlocked mobile phone? We are consumers but we also know how marketing can deceive you if we are not wise with our money.",1

OK,"Vodafone is just 'another' telecom provider.  What sets them apart from the others?  Nothing much.. expect for their colour..?Their instore customer service is pretty poor.  Vodafone direct should keep a tighter hold on the dealers they authorise to sell their products because that was the stem of most of our issues.ter the sale.
Complained and complained and complained to customer care.  They started with trying to palm me off for another call and another and another.  When I had enough of that, I was put on hold and transfered to a person to another.  Some foreign call centre man who did not understand me told me I was lying which stemmed another complain from me..

I rate it a 3 because all telecoms are as good as each other - which is not a high standard anyway.
Not much... Red and white colours?
There is nothing outstanding with Vodafone.  Plans are so competitive these days...

Which is very frustrating in a comunications based business.",4
Terrible,"No customer service at all. They couldn't care less if your unhappy, or if you have a problem. Calling is a complete was of time.

Bad,Coverage is getting worse at my place.  Virtually no signal at all at home now.... All 5 people I spoke to were Indians.  Can hardly understand them. Its very frustrating telling 5 different people the same information and all 5 people had to verify my details and mobile number!  Got the worst headache after talking to them.  I will switch toi someone else after my contract has expired,2
Excellent,"I have pre-paid mobile broadband with vodafone and my mobile phone on  pre-paid as well. I've had the mobile phone with them for as long as I can remember and changed my broadband to vodafone when I did away with my land line. The broadband coverage and speeds are excellent and I've had very few problems with dropouts. Likewise, as long as you know where you can't get coverage with your vodafone mobile you can mange with it. I have noticed that many more places now have coverage. A good tip, buy your pre-paid recharges in Safeway/Woolworth and you get 10%off.I've been with Vodafone for a number of years now and wouldn't change.The coverage is gradually getting better but there are still some areas where you can't get a vodafone signal",5
Bad,"I'm using their mobile broadband. The coverage of my regular train root is bad, but maybe other providers won't cover it better.As for the web-site and the procedures, it's just weird and unprofessional. You need to try it out yourself to understand what I mean. For instance, it sends you e-mails that you have to answer by typing your response in a particular space in the original e-mail. They won't reply if you do something incorrectly. The modem software does not work properly, constantly crashes and needs to be reconnected or killed using Task Manager every now and then.Nothing so farUnstable and weird web site/billing activation/support requests/etc. Faulty mobile broadband modem software.",2
Terrible,"If you like to be ripped off go vodaphone, where you are told that you pay in advance but when your contract finally comes to an end and you can smell the freedom you suddenly have not been paying in advance and owe them and of course they are taking it from your bank account. One of the most outrageous abuses I have endured from them was when I asked to speak with a supervisor after about 20 minutes on the phone and getting nowhere with an employee who then refused to get a supervisor and continued argueing with me after another 15 minutes of that he said a superviser would call,good job I was not holding my breathe. I would be worm food by now and still no supervisor. Not once have I ever felt a was a valued customer.

Excellent,"I have been with vodafone on and off (mostly on) for over 10 years.  It is by far the best provider I have come across compared to telstra and optus.  the customer service can be annoying at times but they always end up keeping me happy whether it be by a credit to my account or allowing me to cancel my contract (internet) no penalty.  LARA can be annoying, she sounds to chirpy which grates me the wrong way on occasion.  Overall very happy with Vodafone!!Good service, Great mobile plans.Internet plan was a dud for me but they did cancel my contract and refund me eventually.",5

I hate having to deal with any network customer service over the phone or instore i always feel im being conned.I like the caps I think you get a lot more for your money than other mobile providers. decent range of mobile phones, they have competive plans.I have never liked the customer service in store or telephone expecially over the phone, on pre paid you have one month to use your credit before it expires.",4
Good,"I have been with vodafone for almost 10 years now and have found their products and services to be quite good. They are easy to deal with and have always had pleasant dealings with their customer service team. My only problem is since moving to a new house my reception tends to be a bit flaky (only at my new suburb) but other than that i have found the network to be very reliable. I'm very happy with vodafone and will continue to use and recommend themCompetitive plans, good customer serviceReception in some areas are a bit flaky",4
Terrible,"Good prices but dishonest and false marketing in terms of the coverage Vodafone provides. Their customer service people are friendly but not very helpful.Friendly customer service and relatively low prices.Quite incompetent customer service representatives who are only interested in avoiding personal accountability. The coverage is a joke. Vodafone claims to have coverage of 94% of Australia's population, which is an outright lie. I live in Watsons Bay and there was supposed to be ""full 3G coverage"" there. Of course, this was not the case. Vodafone lures customers in with low prices and then they are stuck in 24-month contracts with poor reception. If anything, this is false marketing.",1

OK,"I have used Vodafone off and on over the years for mobile phone use and found them to be a pretty good provider. I mainly use pre paid services for mobile phones as I have found this to be the best way to keep my costs down.

Not a bad phone provider.Offer good pre paid services in particular, not too expensive when compared with other companies.The reception can be a bit hit and miss depending on where you live.",3
OK,"Vodafone has a lot going for it if you're a traveller or have a lot of friends overseas.  Inernational txt cost the same as local.  They offer a variety of prepay options.  One definite bonus for me was their plan that allows you to top up and have the credit last up to 2 months (unlike most companies where unused prepay credit expires at the end of each month).  Topping up $30 can last 2 months and includes 100 free txt and 50 free minutes.  One of the few 'real' prepay plans offered in Australia.  They also have a 365 day prepay for those of you  who only use your phone every now and then and dont want to have to top up every month.
The main disadvantage is that reception can be poor in the areas which appear to be low priority for Vodafone (in my case West Sydney).
Cheaper international txts.  Reasonable prepay plans
poor reception at times",3
Bad,"Living in a fire zone area, I would be unable to receive an emergency call as the signal is so poor now. I have been with Vodafone for a number of years and never had this signal problem.

I am scoring only for the plans.I like the CAPS that are offered with Vodafone, great value for money.Unfortunately, living in Central Victoria over the last few months the signal has declined significantly to the stage that it is impossible for people to phone me anymore.

They should pay me commission with the amount of people i get to sign up with them. i am on the $99 cap with unlimited calls, messages and mss and 1.5 gig of internet of my iphone. Im pretty happy with that deal! I find talking to their call centre very easy, i recently had a $900 bill because the girl at crazy johns didnt forward my new contract to vodafone when i got my iphone but they credited my account straight away no hassle. they followed up calls, they called me when they said they would call. great customer service. i wont be leaving them anytime soon. much better than optus and telstra.
great plans, you do get alot for your money
you dont get full reception everywhere",5
Bad,"i have been with vodafone for six years and I have to say that I am very unhappy wtih their service. That said, I find it nearly impossible to change providers. They are very cheap and I get great value, but they have stuffed up my bill so many times over the years i am sure they all know me by name at head office. Their service to existing customers also leaves a lot to be desired. They barely offer any above and beyond assistance which is just frustrating when their is an issue. I have had three phones break after the first twelve months and they have always recommend I buy a vodafone prepaid rather than actually offer me help. My warning is to be careful when using them. They prefer to grab new customers.
Value caps are great value for money, phones available on plans are some of the best out there at the time, the internet service is great for city use and vodafone have heaps of stores around australia.
Talking to 'LARA' over the phone is very annoying, their service in head office leaves a lot to be desired especially when it comes to dodgy billing or issues with phones, plans etc. Their contacts are iron clad and are very impossible to walk away happy from.",2
Good,"I changed to Vodafone when I was done wrong by Optus. I have to say, I am much happier being on a monthly prepaid plan. I pay $29 per month and receive $150 credit (it used to be $130 but has recently been increased to $150). I am also very pleased with their changes to how international roaming work. A few years ago, you had to pay for international roaming credit separately, but now it's included in your prepaid credit once you have activated your phone to allow for gobal roaming. This means I can easily recharge my phone credit overseas when I run out. I am very happy with the service.Reliable service and mobile phone reception. Recharge can be done easily over the phone if you have registered your credit card.",4
Good,"Vodafone need to start picking up their game and become more competitive and give a better service with the internet. I have problems and I'm using the modem at Seaton in South Australia which is only 10 minutes from the city. I would have expected better the internet but I'm fairly happy with the mobile phone service.Easy to use, internet is good value. No charge for roaming in Australia with mobile broadband.Almost as soon as they merged with 3, the SMS prices went up over 15% which isn't good for me because I only send text messages. The reception of the mobile internet is horrible and useless in some places.",4
OK,"Vodafone's mobile phone service provides above average levels of coverage in metropolitan areas at competitive prices. Their level of coverage is generally fine, although there are some black spots within the Sydney metropolitan area.  Vodafone's pre-installed firmware on many of their handsets can be quite unattractive and hurts the visual appeal of the phone.  Overall, Vodafone provides a competitive option to Optus and Telstra, and their recent merger with 3 mobile will hopefully improve their entertainment content as well.Wide range of plans and services.  Best mate option gives you unlimited calls to a particular number.  The 365 day credit expiry prepaid plan is great value if you only need your phone for emergencies.
Prices are a bit high for what you are getting.",3

Having said that the team members at my local store are always friendly and have always been willing to help me when I have had a problem arrise.  No real problems except the poor coverage.Cheap phones and good bundle deals on phones and data packs.Their reception for mobile phones is very limited.

Terrible,"Rip-off. Their network stopped working, but they won't refund my $150 data voucher! After purchasing a 12GB voucher, their network stopped working. They refunded my USB modem, but would not refund any of my voucher.   The service worked fine for the first 2 weeks or so. So I purchased a $150 12 GB voucher. A week later, the service was intermittent: 10 minutes up, 10 minutes down. I called technical support. They said it was a problem in their network and I should wait 1 day. The next day, nothing changed. So I called again. This time, the support technician said the problems are due to the fact that I was in a congested area. I said if that's how the 3G service is going to be, it is not acceptable. She told me I could get a refund on the modem but not on the $150 I paid for the data plan. I asked to speak to the manager and was connected with her supervisor [name censored]. At first, [name censored] tried to fix my problem technically. He suggested I use the USB extension cable, because that should improve reception. And if that doesn't work, he assured me I could get a refund on both the modem and the voucher if I took my reciepts back to the store where I purchased them. So I tried using the USB extension cable for a day and connectivity was no better. The next day, I brought all my receipts and modem back to the store. After explaining to the clerk, he told me, he thinks they could not refund my voucher. I told him the manager [name censored] had already approved this. He said he would look up my records at customer support. We waited around 30 minutes for the customer support on the phone. Then I explained to his store manager. Then when we finally spoke to a customer support manager on the phone (his name was [name censored]) I explained to him all over again.   Manager [name censored] said company policy prevents him from giving refunds on vouchers. All he could do was give me a credit toward my Vodaphone mobile phone account. But I don't even use a mobile phone, so it was useless. I told him it is wrong to sell a service that doesn't work and then keep peoples money. He insisted that's all he could do. He said if I wasn't satisfied, I could take it up with some telecommunications industry watch dog in Australia. Instead, I will take this up with my credit card bank and try to chargeback my money for having no service received.
Good price.

Some of the consultants are lazy about assisting. Dropouts and coverage is very average.Vodafone offer some good value plans and have a number you can call to access consultants and a running account tally. The plan we are on is the $29 per month with $150 free calls (This includes GST). We are also able to call another nominated phone for free.Staff appear to have no ability to correct or recalculate a bill so when an error happens or you are mistakenly charged they can not correct it. We got charged over $450 of network downloads (in a week) we hadn't used. No one could tell us what they were. They did eventually drop the charges but, were unable to reissue the bill hence unable to recalculate. Even though the download charges were dropped our free calls were used up by them hence they needed to recalculate the bill. I found it took me three consultants before I found one that would bother doing calculations apart from just looking at the bill summary and was willing to admit their error. They ended up crediting our account with some free calls but, as we probably won't use them we will still be around $55 out of pocket. I it took around 5 hours on the phone to sort the problem out. Coverage is intermittent and dropouts frequent.",2

Terrible,"Vodafone plans are expensive compared to the plans you have in the US.  IT is not only this but most of the time, they are cheaters as even if you cannot establish contact, they chrage you anyways, particularly on internaional calls. I used to buy 12 recharges per months but now, am only buying 1 as I use the internet to communicate to my colleagues abroad.  Alternatively, I use telstra and buy prepaid cards (I have 350 minutes for international calls) and pay 50 cents only per call.  That is way better than being ripped off by vodafone, wich I tink is just worried about making profit in front of customer satisfaction.

OK,"I get alot of value by being a pre paid customer as stated above in pros, but the phone reception at times is really bad and if you live in a remote area its probably not the best provider. Also sometimes my text messages dont get to other people and sometimes i dont receieve other peoples text messages to me. At the moment im not too fussed but if they continue to get worse i will be switching providers.Im on a prepaid plan and i get $150 worth of calls for only $29. They are very competitive also.Phone reception is pretty crappy at times. Also at times have had no service at all for over 24 hours despite being in a major city.",3
Terrible,I got disconnected from my Internet package without notice because they accidentally sent my bill to another address despite getting the address correct on my contract. 5 weeks later and I'm still getting fobbed off with reasons why I haven't been reconnected. I'm still paying and can't get out the contract.Reasonably Priced Internet PackageCustomer Service the worst I've ever come across.,1
OK,"Great overall aservice if you stick to the major towns/cities of Australia. Regional service coverage is poor and I guess that isn't the market thye care for. Th emoney being were the people are. Theproducts they offer are great a bit difficult to decide which package is best but that is the same with all mobile providers after all they aren't there to loose money. The phone I use is a nokia it was purchased on a 18 month plan approx $70 per month average phone bill was $100 before i changed to this plan so I'm happy.good coverage fair price, good products, easy billing sericesIf something goes wrong it is painful to fix",3
Excellent,"Vodafone are great.  I find they have great plans and can usuall find something or change your plan to suit you when your life changes.  I have never had any problems getting a new phone when I have needed it, they have an easy to use website that you can use to look up products and services as well as manage your bill.  They can email your bill to you and they also text you to let you know they have emailled your bill and they are also very helpful and patient if you have an overdue bill.  I think they are helpful and great!Great plans, easy to get a new phone when needed, great website to manage your account, they can email bills",5
Excellent,"I changed from Vodafone to Crazy Johns a couple weeks ago because they had cheaper Cap Plans.  I regret this severely.  I have had to call Crazy Johns customer service a few times and have to wait an average of 30mins on hold.  The last call I made, I waited 55mins, then just hung up. Vodafone is awesome, I regret I left, but I will be back asap.Awesome customer service, very easy to check Cap usageSlightly more expensive plans than a couple other providers",5
Good,I joined vodafone about 9 years ago on a pay as you go type contract.  It's great as I rally only use my mobile for emergencies or to ring fmaily members who are also on Vodafone.  It has great rates for Vodafone to vodafone and can ring my mum in eastern states for about 20cents as she is on vodafone pre-paid.  Have never had any problems with the network.  Bills are now electronically sent - so saves paper.  Only problem is the limtied coverage in some country areas of WA when we have gone on holidays.suits my lifestyle,4
Terrible,"medium service quality, seem to be too focused on australia, not convenient to settle bills, webiste not really friendly, bad network frm time to timeI am glad to buy vodafone recharges once evry 4 months...Everytime I try to call overseas, the network doesn`t seem to work on the 49$ recharge; concerning the internet connection, I cannot understand why one needs a damn PR to get it as for me, it looks like a stupid marketing strategy; I would advise vodafone to tailor a special offer for students as they may get very good profit for it. tertio, why accept only local credit cards for a company who is itself international...once again, I prefer not buying your product as you guys seem not to be even willing to do business correctly!!!!",1
Good,"Great company to have prepaid with, different recharge amounts ($29 = $150, $49 = $300), have just made it so that you can use your credit how you want to use it, able to download free items every month!the $29 recharge that gives you $150 in prepaid calls; for sept and oct 09, you can access Facebook for free! Vodafone Live is good, easy to use. Free Voicemail (prepaid).you have to have credit to access free Voicemail.",4
Bad,"Long term prepaid account usage major advantage but trying to active online is a nightmare....try the phone...you go around and around talking to a machine.....give up and ring during business hours...surprise surpise you can get to talk to a real person....who tells you they are having problems with their online service...and don't know when fixed..they could not even take credit card recharge over the phone. I was told ...go an buy a recharge card...then ring back.............luckily I found a store near by.....and was able to recharge by buying then ringing again !!!!...but this time someone was able to accept..............if it got any worse....I was going to give them the flick
Long term 365 day account
Frustrating trying to active account and pay by credit card on line",2
Excellent,"I have been with Vodafone for over 10 years, they have great coverage and service. Always offer pretty good plans and upgrades. I have never had any issues with Vodafone, all inquiries have always been dealt with in a timely manner and they are always helpful. The service rarely drops out and has good coverage! Even when internationally roaming the rates were cheaper than most other mobile carriers.Good coverage, excellent customer service and well pricedThat they charge you for paper billing",5
Excellent,"I am not sure about the vodafone plan since I only use the prepaid card. If you have high school kids that need to use the mobile phone. I can remommend you to use this prepaid, since it can last up to one year without loosing your credit, not like any other prepaid networks.Since I do not use mobile phone alot, I like use the Vodafone prepaid card. This come in handy, especially they have 365 days expiry date. I will not lose any money if I can not finish or forget to renew the prepaid card. Good signal.Nothing in particular.",5
Terrible,"the worst company i have ever had to deal with,seriously, and when i look at some of the other views i am tending to think that a few vodafone employees/representitives have been busy on their laptops...would never recomend vodafone to anyone would not wish such a curse on anyone.nothing at all to tell u the truththe stores i went to always offered poor slow service,and never fixed my problem,then when i wanted to recharge via credit card over the phone on a ifferent credit card it took me over anhour to do so. now i am looking to switching providers and after paying $75 for the code found it did not work and had to contact there customer service who is actually a f#$*in robot that struggles to understand what im saying and wastes my time talking about things i have already attempted, then after 15 minutes of blabbing on the robot finally puts me through to a person who then has a problem with their phoneline from wherever they are (propably india) and i am forced to ring up not once more but twice. finally after over an hour stuffing around their phone works and the guy on the other end is rude and not too keen on listening to what i have to say, he then informs me that vodafone will contact me within 10 workin days (possibly up to 16 days) and they will sort out the problem. also i have problems with the network just disapearing at times and compared to my friends having full service most of the time i am blessed with a whole 1or2 bars or no service at all most of the time.",1
Terrible,"I signed up for their mobile broadband 5GB plan at $39 per month on a 24 month contract. The coverage, speeds and reliability were terrible. For the majority of the time that I persisted in using this service, I experienced dial-up speeds and drop-outs every few minutes, and days at a time where I wasn't even able to connect. I did notice that the best speeds could be achieved sometime after 1 AM when the network was less congested, but gave up trying to connect during peak times.ound advice as ""call back if it's not working in 2 days"". Of course I did not receive any discount for these down periods.

After about a year, my situation changed where I had to have a reliable and fast internet connection. In total I was charged approximately a $250 exit fee (I think it was $20 for each remaining month on my contract).

I now get my Internet through BigPond, and have been really impressed with the service so far. It's a little more expensive, but works as advertised.
For a few months here and there it was tolerable.
Vodafone.",1
Excellent,"I have been with Vodafone for many years and I am happy with their service. They are cheaper than the other service providers and for what you pay you get a whole lot more credit e.g. recharge with $29 voucher and you get $150 worth of credit plus on top of that get $150 extra credit between Vodafone 2 Vodafone so a total value of $300 for just $29. Plus when you buy recharge vouchers from Woolies you get 10% off which is even more of a money saver.Cheap rates; bonus credit when you recharge on the flexicap; free Vodafone 2 Vodafone minutes (talk time;) can do things online instead of calling customer service such as activate sim cards, recharge, check balance, check bills etc.
Sometimes there are delays when trying to get through to customer service; reception coverage sometimes drops out.",5
Terrible,"This service has completely disappointed me. I expected a nice and sound internet with stable connection and a persistent speed. What I got was a pathetic attempt to compete with other networks internet. The coverage was horrible. The unreliability greatly works me up. It's so frustrating trying to use one. I should have taken a look on the internet reviews before buying this because now I'm on a contract and however tempting it is to cancel it with 180 dollars i don't have the money on my right now. Vodafone just created this as a way to not be left out in the internet broadband craze. Vodafone has disgraced itself with a horrible product. I recommend never to get Vodafone as your ISP as long as you live.

Completely unreliable, unstable connections, hopeless, days were the coverage completely falls out, fails at basic operations, vodafone.",1
Bad,"I got Vodafone for my daughter and was told coverage here was good. The only place she can get service is at home in 1 room only and in front yard only she has no service for almost a 20klm radius, yet we were guaranteed cover. My partner is with optus his drops in and out, I am with Telstra and I always have service. Vodafone just does not have the coverage they claim to have.good pre paid plans on $29 jumbo capcannot get service 90% of surrounding area where I live yet my telstra phone always has service",2
Terrible,"I use vodafone mobile internet in the  Adelaide region. The service simply sucks, cusomter service is abs disgusting. For broadband service, they use the same customer care number as mobile phone service.You always get lost in the IVR options and never be able to talk to a customer service agent. They also have a poor coverage and top of all they never repair it or update you or let you get out of the contract. Overall it sucks.Be careful",1
OK,"I've had vodafone for 8 years and have overall been pretty happy with the service, I currently have a cap which is pretty good value.I like the caps and free phones on contractHaving to pay to retrieve voicemail. Reception coverage SUCKS! Useless service if you go away from the city alot",3
Excellent,"I've been on Vodafone mobiz (post paid without plan/contract) for a few years. So far, I'm happy with the service. The rate is competitive. I can access my billing and its detail via website. The website is very comprehensive, easy to navigate and easy to access. Since I've rarely been outside of suburbia or regional areas, the service coverage isn't a big issue for me.Competitive rates. Comprehensive website and easy to navigate.During the peak seasons like Xmas or new year, sending sms can be a traffic jam and message can be lost-in-action.",5
Excellent,"For me, Vodaphone prepaid is great. Voicemail calling is free and it takes around a year for credit to run out, and by then it's usually all gone. I don't really like the Vodaphone Lounge and all those things, as they takse ages to load on my phone. I've never had problems with Vodaphone over the many years that I used it.I especially like the prepaid, it's really cheap and the credit last for a year without running out. I've never had any problems.Nothing, but I only know about Vodaphone prepaid so I can't say much.",5
OK,"Suggest you check the coverage map and think about where you are likely to travel before changing to Vodafone.  No matter how great the plan is, or the service, if you can't use it when you want to it kind of makes the phone pointless.  Personally I have moved on to Optus, and have not had any coverage problems since.Love the flexibility of plans, and rates seemed reasonable.Coverage, once you are outside of suburbia coverage starts to drop dramatically.  And for those regional areas where there is coverage it will only be in towns and along major highways.",3
Good,i have been with vodafone for about a year now and they have not let me down i have the turbocharge pre paid account and for $29 you get around $150 worth of value but you cant buy ring tones or games for your phone with it. and customer service is really helpful they help you with whatever you need and fix the problem. they changed there service numbers a while ago and that confused me and a few other people i no is with it but i no a couple of the new ones nowthey have good prepaid plans which you can change when you wantthe prepaid credit only lasts one month,4
OK,Overall I have found they do have good customer service and if you complain they do look after you where they can ie they will usually reimburse you on some level if you feel you have been incovenienced etc ie when i changed over there was some technical issue and it took an extra day to get connected - i complained and they gave me a month for free - i was very satisfied with this. Although the coverage hasnt proved to be so great i will probably continue to use this at this time as they do the job on every other level.Good value for money. Had a good phone deal at the time...Coverage is terrible. I recently went away and my partner is with a different provider - he had coverage and I had none for most of the part.,3
Excellent,"havent had to think about changing to anyone else in over 3 years, never loose conection, and there deals are the best thus far. Different plans for different people and they dont discriminate if its prepaid. i think we get the better deal. my whole family is on Vodafone.Always had prompt,reliable service, staff are quick to assistthat we cant carry our prepaid unused $ over if we recharge before the month runs out.",5
Excellent,i liked the service from vodaphone because im on a plan with them and they have very good help and support. theey have a great range of phones to choose from and the rates are very low. they have some good special deals with some good features and benefits for the customer such as free calls and cap plans. i think they are a world class provider in australia and around the world. they are world class. i like the cap plans from my point of view and they are much simpler and no strings attached compared to optus!good plan and ratesnot good for long distances,5
Good,"Vodafone offer a range of plans for those of us who are still low volume users and that is getting harder and harder to find. Their inability to limit the Vodafone - Vodafone free time means I have hours and hours on my account.rd to beat. Whenever I get annoyed with them and look around for another provider I can't fnd one that offers what I need for the right price.
* Excellent range of low usage plans
* Cheap Vodafone - Vodafone calls with lots of free time when I recharge
* Their billing problems always seem to favour the customer over the company
* Coverage, limited in my home town
* Customer Service phone support...",4
Excellent,I have got no problems with Vodafone.  I recharge via their website so I never have to contact their call cente and the coverage is adequate.I have only ever been with Vodafone and found that they provide a reliable mobile phone service at reasonable prices.  I am now on prepaid and the 365 day recharge is an excellent option for me who only needs a mobile to mostly receive calls as opposed to making them.Their website is painfully slow sometimes when I am trying to recharge.,5
Excellent,"I personally would have stayed with Vodafone, hadn't it being for the reception issue. Now I use, my mobile phone only for emergencies and if I can't trust the reception in the shopping centre or bad weather, how can I trust it in a car emeregency or whatever. I have changed to Optus since.",5
Excellent,"Vodafone was the first company I had a mobile phone with, I was with them for about 8 or more years and found them to be fantastic.They even sent me a free phone for being such a good customer, no contract or anything,its very rare to recieve something for nothing.Unfortunately when I moved to where I currently live there was no reception and 5 years on things have not changed, had to change to Optus but regularly go into the Vodafone store to ask how the tower is coming along, wish they would hurry, I will be switching back.Look after their customers,helpful staff in the office.Vodafone has no reception where I am now living.",5
Good,"i am still happy with vodafone. coverage is goods. 3 g service good but as per the con it can be a bit expensive calling a voda firend, same as calling anyone else. but you get what you pay for.Excellent pre paid dealsthat they removed the voda to voda rates so calling friends isnt that cheap any more",4
Good,"Not a bad telco, I used to use them but now I don't use them other than for free VF2VF calls, but I keep the account for the music store. It costs only $1.80 for a song (they are $1.99 but if you recharge at Woolies you get 10% off) and you get a mobile copy AND a PC copy, and there's a huge collection of songs.Awesome reception (even better than Telstra CDMA)BEST EVER MOBILE MUSIC STORE10% off recharges at Woolies, Dick Smith, Big W, Tandy etc.Prepaid caps are OKFree minutesSometimes bad customer service (I have waited on hold for an hour once, but then another time when I complained about something straight away he gave me $20 credit and extended my call credit expiry by 2 weeks)
Sometimes 3G coverage isn't so good
Prepaid caps are a bit confusing
You have to pay flagfall when you use your free minutes",4
Great for the first few days,"The customer care team is useless and 'are not taking calls today', it is impossible to contact anyone in relation to any problems, you cant change your plan because there are 'technical issues' and no one is available to help and you keep getting shifted from person to person with no resolve to problems. Nbn keeps dropping out and is slower than promised.",1
Internet very slow. Frequent drop outs. Can't register for Vodafone.,What has happened to Vodafone? Internet works on and off. Previously worked well. Can't register for My Vodafone. SMS to get a password never arrives. What is happening? 30 words.,1
Disrespectful and Rude Customer Service,Overcharging customers and no reversal options. The network is unreliable and customer service is rude. They will only ask you for a review or rate the customer care experience if you had a positive outcome. Thatâ€™s not an ethical business model.,1
Bad experience,"Very poor network service , Need to improve Your network quality. I have very bad experience with vodafone.please provide quality service to your customer. Very very bad experience with vodafone thanks.",2
Disappointing,"I have been with Vodafone for over 10 years however I will changing providers as their app is so unreliable, spending over an hour at a time trying to access the app is simply just frustrating and frankly not good enough. For a company this size they should really get their act into gear. Disappointing Vodafone!",1
Absolutely trash,"Data is slow. Topped up $20 worth of data and in expired within hours. Couldnâ€™t top up because the app wasnâ€™t working and it hadnâ€™t been working few a few days, website useless. Do not ever by this trash",1
BEWARE,"Vodafone need to realise that customer service is a big deal in Australia, I was on the phone for 30 minutes transfered from one person to the other with the English language being a barrier, after my many years of being a customer I now say goodbye and good riddens",1
1 star is way too much!,"No reception in most areas of Sydney, forget about using internet. I can't make phone calls inside my house, I have to go ouside to be able to talk with someone. My wife is on Vodafone and has the same issue, so it's not phone issue its network. Customer service is non existing. You can only talk to machine or wait hours to someone pick up or give you a call back. Most of the time they hang up.",1
Useless company,"I was with Vodafone for a long time this company could not careless for its customers, the service is terrible, just read other reviews, also they are now part of TPG which is another company that has no customer service, all they care about is how much money they can bleed out of you, beware of these companies go elsewhere",1
Worst possible customer service,"Unfortunately we lost a phone. Did the right thing and barred the sim immediately, since then trying to get (A) reinstated and then (B) totally close my accounts an absolute nightmare. Have had to go OTT in re-proving all of my ID's to them, each time by email, with response time each time around 3 days, cannot do any task with them on phone call or on chat. Even after doing all this still waiting for response to close accounts. Just an absolute nightmare of bad poor customer service.",1
Mobile Postpaid - Customer Representative Review,"Have been a customer of Vodafone for years on and off.I find their customer service at general enquiries and technical department great if not perfect. Can't believe the flak they receive here. They have always been easy to deal with in regards to my concerns, assisted in a friendly and professional way. They get straight to the problem and resolve it in a timely manner with no fuss whether it be technical issue, setting up new phone or general account enquiries. Sure, some of them have accents that I couldn't understand or names I couldn't pronounce or even bad reception in some areas which is really beyond their control but they get the problems fixed, they're very informative and really tries to help me beyond my initial concern. They don't dawdle around wasting my time.
All in all, I'm one happy customer. Cut them some slack.",5
Stay away,Stay away  from they nbn  useless  1 month  still no internet  hopeless never deal with this again disonest slow false   48 h than  24  than 24  and here 3 weeks almost no nbn,1
Vodafone Greenwood Plaza - Wonderful Service from Danielle,On the 2-3 occasions I have visited this store  Danielle provided excellent customer service and her IT skills were outstanding. I would like to commend Danielle for her professionalism.  She is a true attribute to your store and has exceptional interpersonal and problem solving skills.,5
Always goes back to original price,"In the area of Maylands very bad reception for Vodafone mobile and Vodafone wifi.Another friend of mine has the same problem and he lives in the same area perth metro been like this foralong time.Another problem that happen to me when using Vodafone sim that i did not like at all as when your contract is up with them normally 12 months it reverts back to the undiscounted price.As i've used another mobile company and theirs stayed at the discounted price all the time i was withthem and did not revert back to the original price.Another reason i left.
I found out about this when i changed company my account with them automatically shuts up and you cannot go back into it. Saids technical problem or ring a 1300 number.
I left this company as i found another smaller company that had what i was after that vodafone does not offer. I ask many times if they could lower the price but they did not listen so whats the point in asking a customer what they want when they don't offer or even slightly offer a discount.",3
Vodafone is no.1 cheater in Australia. They are fraud.,"Vodafone is no.1 cheater in Australia. I got prepaid SIM, I got 60GB data first, they told me that I could get 60GB(35GB+25GB bonus) every month if I setup my plan on auto recharge. Upon 2nd recharge they didn't acknowledged that offer instead gave me 45GB. Then I ordered for postpaid Sim, 100GB for $45 monthly plan, after accepting that order they only gave me 60GB for $50. Vodafone is fraud. Also speed is very slow, 4g is not 4g. When you call Vodafone , all support by Indian people. No manner",1
These guys have gotten worse in every way.  U get what u pay for.,These idiots have gotten worse over the last year or so. When my hi speed data is finished i can't even Google.  I was not like this a year ago.When u ring them it goes straight to India. So your already angry then you have to repeat everything u say to someone from India that doesn't understand Aussie english.I'm changing to Telstra.  I will pay more for less stress.Vodaphone has gone down hill.,1
Bad network coverage.,As soon as you take a step out of Metro Melbourne there is no signal.Got rid of them and went with a proper provider.Don't waste your time with them.Leave as soon as possible.,1
Vodafone Australia - The worst telco to deal with,"Vodafone is the worst service provider in Australia. They have partner stores who dont know a thing. A simple thing such as unlocking a prepaid device by paying a fee needs the customer to talk to a dozen people, with no resolution. Have been a postpaid customer 3 years ago, thought they were better....But now they are down the drain. After speaking to their customer support for 24 minutes, the response that I get is, I have to go back to another Vodafone store. Avoid Vodafone. Avoid Vodafone store in Seven Hills, completely useless",1
Dishonest business practice to dishonor consumer warranties,"Vodafone is a budget telco I was quite happy with. Their coverage is not great but their plans are good value with no lock in period.However I made the mistake of purchasing a new phone with them, within two weeks a vertical pink line appeared on the LED screen. Took it back for repair only to find out they have a policy where ""any physical or water damage"" voids your 2 year warranty. Ridiculous as I had a small crack on the frame of my phone which the service centre acknowledged did not cause or contribute to the screen problems it still constituted ""physical damage"" and I was quoted a ridiculous amount (same as cost of new phone) for repair.
Shody business practices designed to rip off consumers entering into agreements in good faith.
Their teams in the stores are helpful but will direct you to their online or phone Customer service team who are patronizing and unhelpful.
Pay a bit more, go with someone else who has a bit more business integrity and save yourself the heartache",1
"Bad data coverage, not reliable","Disappointed!  I could not even log on my app in Docklands, the customer service said there were issue but no solutions! It happened too often, I am done with Vodafone !",1
Customer service have no idea,Several weeks ago i chaged mobile phones my number stayed the same however i was unble to copy my email because i had forgotten the password. I set up a new email notfied vodafone by the myvodfone app and followed up with phone call to ensure that i did it right i was assured that it did.I am receiving emails including my monthly bill at the old email address.I phone customer service today to ask why. I got quicly frustrated by questions this soon turned to anger so i hung up.I am now seriously considering going to another provider who is not attached to vodafone,1
About my bills,"I had Vodafone regarding my account  I spoke customer service last month they sanding total bill $2150 they told me this bill included phone and monthly payment ,I agree ok I explain my situation at Moment then I asked to payment 4 instalment they asked first payment $650 then 3 left then I paid $500 then i have only $1000 remaining today I checked my account they was sanding another $756 again I asked customer service this morning they told me this new bill for phone I confused because last month I agree only $2150 I donâ€™t whatâ€™s going on voddafone this a not good service really they need explaining",1
bad service,I had Vodafone regarding my account my contract had and upgraded my phone with contract prepaid as had previously and now keep on recieving messages I had used up my international minutes which I donâ€™t call any international countries and my comes $138.00 every month this just started with COVID-19 we are been charged for services we donâ€™t know off when phone the call centre you will go from 1 to 7 different people if they understand they hang up on or claiming that they cannot verify you  and saying due privacy  etc but after a minute you will get message saying they were not help so if they could not verify you how is the sent messages since they said they are unable to know who you are.How  sure are they same person sending you a text via isnâ€™t contradictory you just said you canâ€™t  help?? Am I missing something her? They are rude?? When speaking to customers.the service is extremely poor!!,1
Worst customer support ever - dont get traped,"One of the worst service I ever had, customer support team committed that the service will be activated in 4 hours, I should disconnect from previous provide, which I did and now its been 5 days without internet.Each time I call the customer support team they say ""I wish I could help you but I cant its pending with backend team""I requested to talk to Supervisor, but he  cant talk to end customer... one of the worst service ever",1
Do Not Buy a PrePaid Vodafone Phone with Sim!!!,"You can not activate a Vodafone prepaid sim without providing your credit card number, AND agreeing to let them save it, AND agreeing to automatic recharge from your card. Even if you have a recharge voucher for the activation or if the sim already has an amount of credit on it you cannot get through the activation without supplying your card details and agreeing to letting them take money from it!!! This is as well as every single of bit of personal information they want l. Don't waste your money on a Vodafone network locked phone like I did only to find you can't even activate a sim or use the phone!",1
NEVER SIGN UP WITH VODAFONE!!!!,"I was Charged $139.99 and charged me for two months NBN in one billion cycle. terrible service, NBN has been down for 3+ months and no support arrived. Customer services to useless, no help at all, every agent keeps repeating the same information over and over again. once a call is transferred the same information needs to be repeated to the new agent.",1
Denied.,Simply declined upon application of a plan. Have been a prepaid customer for years. Deciding to change providers to someone willing to give me a chance. Honestly pretty disappointed. My credit history isn't that terrible.,1
Do not go with Vodafone!,"I was looking for a new nbn provider - decided to go with Vodafone, then because they took so long to connect I changed my mind (there was no number to call them on in their website for nbn) there is no real email either - the emails go nowhere. I called the Vodafone phone company they gave me a number for  nbn, I called and asked them since it was so long after my request I had decided to change providers and they said ok. The next thing I know is that my new connection is disconnected because Vodafone had decided to connect me. I called them again and told them I had called and told them to disconnect - they assured me that it was disconnected. The same thing happened again a week later. I was told by the new company to put a cease and desist order against Vodafone. I did. I'm still getting bills from Vodafone and have been told by my bank that to get rid of them I have to change my card!",1
garbage!!,"Been with Vodafone for years, decided to upgrade the other day to 2 iphone pro max 11's I was on the phone for 40 minutes.. turns out they didn't place the order.. the person who organized it went on leave and didn't tell me anything about it..(something about only I could get the $250 discount they offered not my wife..After the order was agreed they just didn't do anything to inform me of any issues.Been waiting for days for 2 new phones and they haven't even been ordered yet.",1
Appalling service - ludicrous attitude - inexplicable response,"Vodaphone don't appear to monitor these reviews and clearly don't care so there isn't much point posting this - but I will anyway.ne chat with complete twit who was obsessed with selling me a new phone plan and upgrading me to a $40 SIM plan that I did not want, couldn't tell me how much the new total would be (it came up different every time he added it up), kept saying he could send a new SIM but wouldn't actually arrange it when asked and in the end almost cancelled my daughter's plan for some reason.

While arguing with the first twit I jumped online on a second PC and arranged a replacement SIM with another person - it took 5 minutes.  I specifically asked if we needed to activate the new SIM and was told it was pre-activated.
",1
I have no words to say how bad this service provider is.,"The customer service officers are the worst and they need to use their manners, they have no phone manners they have the worst way to explain things and they can't help you because they are terrible.",1
Worst service ever!!!! I am taking you the communications authority,Worst service ever!!!! I am taking you the communications authority...Do not how to do their jobs and they call a lie. I will make sure the communication commission and the authorities know about how badly you operate your service.,1
Incorrect billing issue not resolved,I did live chat about the billing issue few day ago. The team told me it will be resolved within 48-72 hours but 5 days have been passed and the issue is still pending. I called them again to fix it but they told me to wait again. I do not think they have the capacity to resolved just the incorrect billing,1
Vodafone sucks,I have a plan for 3 year and Iâ€™ve never use all my data 90gb then suddenly Iâ€™ve been paying for extra data that I never used! When you call to the call centre  they ask you to keep your data off but is already off. Then I refused to pay for extra charge because I didnâ€™t use. Now they are charging me for more extra fees for late payment. Itâ€™s a machine to make money on us as a customers and they donâ€™t care about it.,1
Stay away,Bought a starter pack and never received it. Have called 5 times and all they do is say I will put you on hold for 1 to 2 minutes and leave you there for Half an hour! Unable to get a refund for an item that never arrived.,1
Beware of this company in Australia,"Beware of this company in Australia. Very bad customer service, I called three times for a problem, since I bought two phones the price was $ 2,200 and they gave me a year of amazon prime. Later on the invoice they charged me the amount of Amazon Prime and I claimed and they told me that they had been confused and I did not have that offer. Call three times and each time you call they tell you that it is solved and they do nothing. Customer service is very bad, they do nothing to fix it. A disaster. I do not recommend this company.",1
Worst. Minus Score Rating!,"Just don't bother! I was treated so badly as a new customer. No one could give me answers to a SIM that couldn't be activated and a NBN bundle. Very hard to connect with heavy credit checks. I was bounced around so many of their so called departments I felt like a basket ball! I ended up with no connection, no solution and no answers. Vodafone customer service was so substandard that they didn't even know what day of the week it was! They were good at extracting your information tho and saying sorry every 2nd sentence. The whole experience has left me feeling angry, frustrated and anxious about giving away my personal details. After 16hrs over 3 days on hold and chat I cancelled the service as it was just to hard to connect with this super bad telco...Never again vodafone!
If I could give vodafone a -10 star rating it would be to much! Please don't go past this review as I did with others...their cheapish rates are just not worth it! The bad reviews here are 100% correct.",1
Abysmal Customer Service,"My husband and I stay with Vodafone because we get reasonable mobile coverage in an area that generally has poor reception.  Neighbours using other providers are often unable to get reception from inside their homes.ed to another, and then another, often being cut off along the way.  It can take over an hour to have a simple problem resolved. 

My latest issue with them was that my phone was receiving promotional messages from Vodafone, these were addressed to my husband and I couldn't understand why.   Although both phones were initially on an account in his name that ceased in 2017.  After that I changed my phone to a new plan with Vodafone, they were meant to put this into my name. 

To have the issue resolved I turned to live chat.  I now have some hearing loss and didn't want the usual call centre rigmarole.  Live chat worked reasonably well and I finally established that although our phones are on separate accounts they're both in my husbands name.  How to get this fixed?  Make a phone call.

Low coverage,This company sucks!,1
"Worst Coverage, Disappointment and Poor Customer service ever.....","I am been Vodafone customer for 13 years at least. Moving it to new area, coverage gets poor and poorer. I contacted Vodafone and asked me to change sim card as it is old and try after. I changed and even started drop out my battery life on daily basis. Vodafone suggest that some work going around and will get fix soon but It was complete bluff. I am living on same place for almost three years just hoping coverage will gets better one day and it will get fix but its even going worst that I have to come outside my home and stand on main road to talk to someone. 
When I explain Vodafone regarding this they offer me $10 off the plan. Its not worth it about money all the time the drop out continuously affects on daily basis. To coming out of Vodafone they want me to pay remaining installment for my handset worth of $370 left. Is it really??? I been suffering for almost  3 years and they can't do anything. 
All Vodafone said that you should notify us earlier. As a provider they should know better what area they better and what are worst. Not me telling them in this 5G Generation. Just leaving Vodafone is last option.",1
Wish I could give them minus a billion stars,"shocking shocking shockingDo not use them!!!!That would of been enough information but apparently I need to use 30 words.They are useless,8 words to go,make that 5,now 3,now 2 and I'm done!!",1
Huge Disappointment,"I ordered a sim only plan online two weeks ago and what I first don't like is how they ask for your mobile phone as a mandatory requirement for the order to go through. Like for my case, my old phone plan and phone number have expired that's why I am ordering a new plan, asking for my phone number is absolutely nonsense. Calling them is worse, they kept on transfer you through departments and after transferring you they would ask you the same thing which you have to explain. nothing has solved from the call as they said simply just wait? texting them is no different as they transfer you through departments and not bothered to read the old conversation, the guy who I chat to eventually pretended that I have been disconnected for too long and leave the chat? Wow absolutely best impression ever.",1
Worst mobile coverage company ever.,I have been having issues with Vodafone for over a year. The coverage cuts in and out and completely cuts the call off In most cases even though I live in a capital city. People say they have called me but Iâ€™m not notified of any missed calls. Sorting this issue out with Vodafone has been a nightmare. I changed to a different carrier and I would never recommend them to anyone.,1
0 star,i have been using Vodafone more then 7 years with contract....first time my phone need repair and still have warranty and asking me to pay for liquid damage which is lie coz my phone doesn't have even minor scratch and how water went inside the phone even its waterproof....but they lie to me by saying they sending my phone to Samsung but they didn't they said after they had own mechanic all they want is to rob people with terrible service so changing my no. to another company.....,1
Horrible service,"Their reception is absolute rubbish, people canâ€™t hear you when you call them, doesnâ€™t matter where your calling from. Has been happening with me and a few other people I know who are with Vodafone. Vodafone wonâ€™t admit their is anything wrong with their service but the question is what ISNT wrong with their service. Their call centre staff are rude and ignorant, I donâ€™t know which is worse, their reception or their customer service. Donâ€™t go with them, better off paying more and going with Optus or Telstra.",1
Very dodgy mobile internet,"I live in Mackay, Queensland, postcode 4740 and mobile internet is worse than 2G- very poor. I m not happy with that at all and thinking about changing to different providers. I been with Vodafone for 12 years and itâ€™s shame that I have to move to different providers.",1
Absolutely pathetic customer service,"Was miss sold a tablet when I upgraded 2 phones on my account.Was told by salesman in Indian call centre that I could have this new galaxy tablet fo an extra 28cents per month. I agreed as it was so cheap it was practically free.Then the 1st bill comes in and I'm being charged $19 a month for the tablet.I tried contacting vodafone about this but this happened around the time of the corona virus 1st lock downs and vodafone were uncontactable for over 3 months ( the joys of having all your workforce in India ).When I finally got through to vodafone i was messed around for a further 5 weeks saying they are looking into this.
Finally I managed to speak with someone in Melbourne in customer retentions who told me as so much time has passed I had to honour the contract and they miraculously didn't have a recording of the phone call when I was miss sold the tablet.
This company is an absolute joke and think they can do as they please and the customer will have to wear it.
Don't make the mistake of going with vodafone 2nd rate service and non existent customer service.",1
been a happy vodafone customer since 2007,"I am surprised by all these negative reviews, i have been with Vodafone for 13 years and i have never had any issues with them. the customer service team are helpful but sometimes a bit difficult to communicate with as there is a bit of a language barrier. i recently upgraded to a galaxy s20 and traded in my old galaxy s9 was given a great price and credit was processed to my account efficiently. they also help you set up  your new phone and transfer all the apps and data from the old one to the new one in a matter of minutes.",4
Instead of being helpful they punish,They continually overcharged for 'unlimited' data. Finally I went to the real Vodafone shop. They were very helpful and could see that the overcharging had been going on for many months.Vodafone was supposed to get back within 48 hours. Instead of that they slowed down the speed. They are near to impossible to get on the phone.,1
Great value for money,Very reliable 4G coverage.The data download speed is fast enough to watch videos. Easy to use app. Good value for money with great phone plans. Good customer service on the chat.,5
"Service is unreliable, so is tech support",My voicemail randomly stops working & when people try to call me they are told that my phone is off when it's not. Technical support said that they would look into it and would call me in about two days. A week later after no call and phone not working I called again. After talking with the tech I was put on hold & then hung up on. No call back.,1
Dealing with Vodafone: An unmitigated nightmare,"For the last three years or so I've been using Vodafone's mobile broadband. I've used the 4G PocketWifi device. It's great portability and ever so slightly lower monthly cost than NBN, so while the value might not be great it's also a plan that really suits me as I don't use much data.However: service frequently drops out, several times every internet session. Internet speeds vary. Now when I tune in for Zoom meetings or teleconferences, I either just use my phone or use my phone hotspot as the vodafone service is so unreliable (or rather, reliably bad). I've always been in greater Melbourne suburbs too, so it's not like I'm in the middle of nowhere.
Morever, using the online account has proved virtually impossible. As I use the SIM for broadband only and not through a mobile phone, when they send codes via SMS (and have no email option) it is frustrating, to say the least. I've been trying to login for the last 20 minutes and have tried to reset my password and username, to no avail. I enter the email addresses I've used in connection with the account and it returns with ""Please enter a valid email address"".
Maybe there's less hassle with using the SIM through a phone, but I'm still very unimpressed with the way Vodafone runs things.",1
Customer service is a joke.,"Been trying to switch to the $10 COVID plan that they so 'generously' offer. Yet, when I apply, I receive no response for over 2 months. During such time I've had to call 4 times to try and get the plan approved. I keep getting told it is being approved, yet my bill does not reflect that. Being strung along to stay with Vodafone. Customer service says one thing on the phone, yet writes a different story in the notes - evidenced when I have to speak to the 3rd and 4th person in 2 months for the same issue, that they cannot fix, because of their own problems.",1
Do not put up with vodafone,"worse experience ever. I would give 0.1 star if they have the option. First i would like to say that i was a loyal customer with vodafone for 10 years and I did not make any complain over the 10 years even though their signal voice call is terrible and the 4G disappear on your phone from time to time. I'm on a $45/month pre paid plan which includes 1000 minutes overseas phone call coverage per month. From 12th June till now, I'm having issue calling overseas. The call disconnected immediately after dialing or no sound or respond after dialing. i reported this issue to vodafone a month ago and they could not fix this issue till this second. After a month telling me they are trying to fix the issue and asking me the same question everyday over the phone, today the technician called me and told me they could not identify the issue from their end and the problem is from the other side overseas. The most ridiculous excuse I have ever heard. I have asked my family and friends in Australia to call the few same overseas numbers that i could not reach using their mobile and their sim card, and all the calls were connected without any issue. And i have tried to put my sim card into their mobile phone to make overseas phone calls, and not succeed. Clearly something wrong with my network (I have replaced a new SIM card at Vodafone shop Recently but still can not make overseas phone calls) , but vodafone told me anything could be wrong with other factors but nothing is wrong with them. One of the staff on the phone offered me $10 credit back into my account to compensate me for wasting all my international call coverage last month. I received a SMS message from vodafone saying a $10 credit will be in my account in 24 hours but it is 2 and half days later and not a cent has been transferred to my account. I could not believe as a big company, they would rather lose their reputation over $10 than save a loyal customer who has spend over $12000 in the past 10 years. I'm so done with vodafone. If you consider to choose a provider, please think twice before you put your trust and money on them.",1
Bad Service,Rang the sales team spoke to agent Jonny from India very bad customer service.  I ask him to read notes on my account regarding my contractor he came back sounds confuse and not have a full knowledge of my situation. I ask him what's his understanding of my contractor but he wasn't undersure. He said the notes are not clear and he will put me back to customer care team to clarify my issue. I told him I don't want to be transfer he needs to deal with but he hesitated and said it's not his department. I ask to speak to a team leader by he confirm my issue it's not his dept. I ask to be transfer to a manager but he advise all manager have gone home. Jonny really needs to be trained very poor customer service there don't want calls to be transfer to TL or manager.,1

Outrageous,"After a few visits and phone calls to Vodafone, they were not able to update my address and I was unable to make phone calls.. For months .. From a prepaid sim card.. Disappointed",1
VodaFAIL 2.0,"Customer services [name removed] gave wrong information. Missing credit which she claimed used up. Credit turned up again after a while. Instead of apologising, made up stories as she went along just to avoid giving back the credit. The audacity to claim, ""I'm looking at your data usage in front of me and your credit was used up.""",1
"Its the worst service provider. They overcharged me due to their technical problem, they donâ€™t get back to resolve it",Its not a good service provider at all.They never get to customer always customer need to get back every time and also they donâ€™t solve the issues. I have received poor service so trying to switch over to other service provider for my new plan.,1
Poor service and security.,I don't get paper bills send out. Vodafone emails the bill. They had a technical problem and could not send me an email bill and now it is my fault that I did not pay. Security on my phone is appalling. Someone is hacking into it. Vodafone is not doing anything about it. Don't listen to their customers complaints and problems.,1
Poor service and security.,I bought a new phone and now will go to another service provider.,1
Worst customer service ever,"After having been with Vodafone for over 10 years, I've decided to cancel my service. At first I couldn't get hold of any customer service representative on the phone so i went into the Mandurah branch to get help there. The first person dismissed my request by saying he couldn't do anything for me. Another employee said that she can cancel it for me and she did it. I didn't get any reference number but thought that my issue was solved until I got more bills. I then called customer service and was again told that they couldn't do anything for me. I will now be contacting the Ombudsman to get my problem resolved. Wouldn't recommend Vodafone to anyone. If you would like to call me about this, I would be happy to speak to someone that can speak English and has more authority.",1
No coverage,Called up multiple times regarding coverage and internet issues lots of promises but no action. Had to buy another phone with another provider for work.Stay away from Vodafone you putting your money in the bin.Worst service ever,1
Outstanding service,I transferred to Vodafone as I wanted a cheaper plan with the same benefits. It was easy and the staff were so helpful transferring me as well from an android phone to an apple phone. Thanks,5
I hate Vodafone. .,"Nothing positive to say after being a customer for 10 years. Terrible value and service. I hope this company goes bankrupt and burns in hell. I once yearâ€™s ago went 2 GB over my data plan was charged $2000, or $1 per megabyte. It was then shortly changed to what it is now $10 per GB, but clearly reducing the amount I and so many others were charged was out of the question. Criminal behaviour, customer service is overseas so you might as well talk to a robot. Poor value on prepaid and coverage is probably the worst of all companies. I genuinely hope it goes down and it probably will",1
Simply designed to rip you off,"FACT 1:  I paid for a My Credit Top Up and the store at Campbelltown Mall instead loaded on Pay As You Go and it was all gone in 1 day , despite me having a pre-paid credit of 5 days , it was used on dataNo refund No hlep3 visits to a Vodafone shop in the past year to prove my identity and re set my pin to exactly the same number and told again today that customer resolutions cannot help me as they cannot identify me .",1
Vodafone Service,Left Optus and moved to Vodafone. Tried calling them today and was hanging on for 1 hour 20 minutes and had to hang up as there were no signs of them picking it up. They are hiding behind Covid19 which is crap. They have taken this opportunity to reduce cost by cutting staff. Will need to move somewhere where there is service but where? Everywhere you go in Australia it is becoming this. They just don't care because everyone dishing out bad service. These company does not do your heart any good.,1
Vodafone is the worst!! They refuse to cancle my plan after asking 5 times ripping me off a $158 month is discusting,Worst coverage.....i cant even use the data i have because Vodafone hasn't worked in any of the last 4 houses ive liven In what a disgrace!!!Vodafone has personally let me down an ripped me off.,1

Donâ€™t sign up unless you are desperate,"Paid the highest plan for nbn, and the speed wouldnâ€™t even pass 24 at itâ€™s peak speed. When I first signed up with the nbn, it was a nightmare experience to begin with. Hardly any follow up nor response until I staid that we were gonna write to the ombudsman. The cancelled the nbn instalment without notice too on top of that. Wasted 3 days after receiving the modem to just finally get them to give an ok connection with a new date for nbn tech to come in to the property.ne call usually takes too long with nonstop transferring and nonstop idâ€™ing (they donâ€™t do warm transfer, do you would need to Iâ€™d yourself n repeat everything for every person you get transferred to). Their customer service chat takes so long, and stopped working all together without replying to my initial request (mind you, this is after almost 30mins on the chat). Trying to call now since thereâ€™s no email to contact them. Have been on hold for 30mins and still waiting.

Unless you are like me, who is stuck with a contract. Run. Donâ€™t sign up with this provider. Their customer service and coverage used to be much better than this. Seems like they donâ€™t care about current customers anymore now.",1

We are paying $377 a month and recently  bought a Samsung Active 2 watch for $649. The watch started overheating and died in two hours after 8 weeks we took it to Vodafone and they sent it in for repairs. After two weeks we got it back and they told us they couldn't identify a fault if it happens again take it to Samsung. The next day the watch overheated and died after two hours. I called Vodafone and told them what had happend and they told us its not their problem to take it to Samsung. We told them that we don't have a Samsung store near us, and we had spoken to fair trading who told us they need to fix it as they are the ones that sold it to us. They told us me I have no rights and they wont be doing anything.  I wouldn't recommend them because when something goes wrong they wont help and its not worth the trouble.",1
Vodafone advertising that we helping during covid19 its completely nonsense. Nasty people donâ€™t trust.

Most of the time only one or 2 bars.,1
"Bad coverage in Morley, Perth WA and unreliable service resolution","Vodafone doesn't seem to have the technical reach to deliver reliable internet, although their customer service is polite, but too many times now they cannot resolve my terrible internet connection for a wireless broadband connection.  I have been a customer for many many years and so disappointed because for a while there they really did get better for maybe 8 years. They are certainly polite but good manners can't deliver the services paid for.f you depend on good internet connection for wrok. I'm keeping their phone service, just signed up to a different NBN service for internet, and cutting down to the basics with my Vodafone. I can't in good faith recommend them to anybody in north metro Western Australia for internet connection reliability.  Of course they might be fine anywhere else.",1

1 star is too much for Vodafone! They are liars who try to steal money from you. Vodafone is not to be trusted!,"I ordered a phone and a plan on Feb 2020. They did not deliver the phone after 10 business days. After calling them 4 times and waiting for like an hour on the line each time, they finally told me to go to a Vodafone store and pick up my phone. I went there and picked up the phone. They told me that they will waive the first 2 months charges because of the hassle they caused. In March they sent me a bill. I was expecting to pay nothing as they promised, instead I got a bill for nearly 2,000 dollar(yes you read right 2 thousand dollars). I thought this must be a mistake and did not really pay attention to it. A few days later they direct debited nearly 2,000 dollars out of my account !!!! I had to call them to fix this issue, but they would not pick up. You may think this cannot be true but I was on different calls with them for 6 straight hours until one of them told me to call my bank to revert the transaction and it will be fixed. I called my bank to revert the transaction and they did. next month they sent another ridiculous bill of nearly 2,000 dollars. I called them again and waisted another 3 hours to be able to talk to someone and they told me to wait 48 hours and it will be fixed. But it was not fixed, the next month the same thing happened. I decided to go to TIO to file a complaint against them. That is when someone actually tried to fix the issue after 3 months. Everyone I talked to was unhelpful and not only did not fix the issue but also was rude. They kept saying ""rest assured this will be automatically fixed within 24-48 hours"" which was just a lie. They do not send confirmation email to get themselves out of it. They only make promises over the phone without sending confirmation emails. 
I am not saying this becasue I am angry (I am angry!!!) I am saying for the sake of people who do not want to waste their time with a company who lacks customer service and is sitting there to steal money. PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM VODAFONE! I made a mistake and did not research them prior buying from them but I would never buy from them I started over.",1

'We are prioritising people with..... enquiries' If I've been prioritised I'd hate to be one of those that haven't been. Vodafone doesn't care what your issue is or how stressed it's making you. You're one of the biggest telco companies in the world. DO YOUR JOB. Sick of the sorry of keeping you waiting message and the crappy music.,1
Worse provider to be with :(,Itâ€™s been over 4 years since Iâ€™ve requested for my reception/network issue in Harrison & in civic yet they have not fixed it :(Every time I logged complain same excuse given .....,1
Terrible provider with no customer service,Vodafone has almost no customer service whatsoever. I am actually surprised that they do not even have an email address you can email or an online chat option. If you have any issues you have no choice but to call and be on hold for indefinite periods of time. If you are unable to get through and still have issues with your phone they will continue to charge you. In that sense there is little incentive to address your problems promptly.,1
Auto Recharging 2 days early,I am on an unlimited plan which is automatically recharged every 35 days. For the last 6 months my recharge date on my app is actually 37 not 35 but will auto recharge 2 days before the date given. I have lost all the data i had left every month and have spent hours upon hours trying to get this fixed wuth no resolution. I wonder hiw many others are being ripped off without even realizing it. The recharge date should   match the actual date of recharge and not to be done 2 days earlier.,1

If I could give 0 I would,"This company is a joke. The customer service is appalling. Iâ€™ve been unable to get into my Vodafone and no one seems to be able to fix it. Iâ€™ve tried registering and it doesnâ€™t work whether Iâ€™m on wifi or cellular data. Iâ€™ve rang the customer service twice to no avail. Both times on hold for an hour and then they have no idea how to fix it and it will need to be escalated which will be done within a week. 3 weeks later and still nothing so I put in an online complaint. I had some guy respond with a generic response not even reading what Iâ€™ve written. An absolute waste of time and if youâ€™re considering Vodafone, DONT.",1
Do not waste your money!,"Despite being a long standing customer, Vodafone continued to demonstrate the lowest quality of customer service skills whenever I needed matters addressed. They guarantee coverage;however, their coverage is by far the worst!! They do not care about the service you are receiving as long as they get the money. Itâ€™s appalling  to know that no matter how long you stay with them, they continue to show no acknowledgement and urgency to fix issues. Do not be fooled by their phone plans as it may look good but not when you literally get no coverage for the services youâ€™re paying! Very disappointing!",1
Need to know when my contract finishes,"Need to know when my contract finishes, waiting 15 minutes already on hold, why I can not see it in vodafone app. It says there I have to call them.",1
HELPFUL,"Vodafone service is good , I have 5 years experience with Vodafone. Iâ€™m very happy with the customer support, they are very helpful. I recommend Vodafone for best experience. Thank You",5
Not good,Wait 2 hours to get a rude customer service person. Automated obnoxious music and messages repeating over and over again. Useless service. Poor coverage. Have complained about poor coverage and no response adequate. So disapointed.,1
Vodafone scam service for internet data,"I have been with Vodafone for over 4 years. I paid over $60+ for less than 2GB plan data. I would always seem to finish my internet data despite using very little internet.
Vodafone is such a scam!!",1
Great,"I've just had an excellent experience with Revesby Vodafone.  Adam changed my phone over to the 60GB red plus plan for $50 each month.  I watch ABC iview on my phone and I hotspot to my laptop, so this is ideal for me.  Adam was patient and professional as he worked through my request.  Thank you Vodafone and Adam.",5
"Inconsiderate, unsympathetic",I had wished it did not come to this stage. I waited for 2 months and finally decided if no one is going to listen I will have to go through this channel. I have been with vodafone since 12 years and this is the first time I needed help. They sold me a faulty handset and people from their Melton woodgrove store and from their customer support are only wasting my time. Making callous comments and no help at all. They are saying we are only supporting urgent inquiries so a faulty handset is not an urgent inquiry? If someone wants to buy a new service they are all ears but not to resolve an inquiry from on old customer. Worst customer service.,1
Terrible,2 hours waiting on customer service is too much.   I had to call Vodafone because they couldn't transfer my number from telstra for ten days. Issue is not resolved so far.Shame on you Vodafone!,1
Worst wait times to get customer service I've ever dealt with!,"Currently on hold to Vodafone and have been for 1 hour and 50 minutes (and counting). Ive been with them ever since 3 brought them - like way back in 2013 I think - TBH never had any issues. So happy with everything, customer service, internet service, price.That has all changed in the past week since my NBN connection has just been dropping out. Ive called 4 times (all over an hour wait time + today - which is still pending but on the verge of 2 hours waiting on hold) Im a calm and polite person but anyone waiting this long for an issue which has still not been fixed after 5 calls would drive anyone crazy.Just not good enough - and stop blaming corona for your slack customer service issues - lift your game Vodafone!",2
Worst service at Ipswich store,"I went to the Ipswich store to change over a new 5g phone for a different model. Was told earlier in the week by online staff that this would be no problem if the case is not opened but had to be done at a store. At the Ipswich store I was met at the entrance by a girl with pink hair who told me to step back behind the yellow line outside the store. From there she questioned me about my reasons for coming to the store and if I had travelled in the past few weeks (??) and if I had a fever. I was then permitted to enter as she called out my requirements to another girl at the counter. That girl then went out the back and returned with [name removed] the manager. [name removed] bluntly told me that the phone could not be exchanged because it was a change of mind. Unbelievably difficult individual. Why annoy a business customer for no reason? They treat you like a leper and then they have a truly rotten, unhelpful attitude as well. Stay away from them.",1
"HORRIBLE SERVICE, when you need to contact them for help good luck!","I Have attempted to call Vodafone multiple times for days in a  row now, you get put on hold for hours then get hung up on. Worst customer service youâ€™ll ever receive.",1
no customer service during Covid-19,"My NBN have been playing up for almost a week and that it went on and off every now and then. I tried not to pick up the call to ring as I expect there will be some waiting time and Vodafone still surprised me when I finally made the decision to call.40mins waiting resulted with nothing only with a repeated message that they only help you if you have a not working NBN. I am working from home and home Internet is crucial to me as my company use IP phone PC app to make calls with the customer. I can't imagine how my customer will be annoyed if they are put 40mins on waiting and finding no way they can talk to a person for help.

Good job Vodafone on earning another one star. Didn't realize they have had such a bad reputation for long time if I didn't jump onto this website.",1
Scammers,They have charged me 500$ as international internet usage in 30 minutes while my international roaming was offHow? Trying to rip me off. How can add ons be added to a nymber that had international roaming turned off!!!!,1
Terrible service. They don't let me cancel account,"I have been trying to contact vodafone through 1300650410 in regards of cancellation of my mobile plan. However, despite waiting for long time on the phone. I'm not being directed to anyone. I was requested to enter ""my Vodafone "" by robot but I am not able to enter my account since I need to get a temporary password and that password is only sent to assigned number. So, since I do not have the sim card I'm not able to receive a temporary password. I went to the shop at Balmain and the guy speak to me with a weird face telling me i should make a call. Now I'm still waiting on the line to be connected after half an hour but no answer. They charge my debit card without asking me if i want to renew my contract at the end of my 2 year contract. They are hopeless, miserable, thieves",1
Decent Provider but Retail Staff Cons you!,"I have no qualms with Vodafone as a network service provider. If you are in civilisation it is up to the mark and reliable. However, their retail sales team is an absolute joke. They will con you by selling you things that you do not need or can find online for 1/10th of the price. The key words that the sales people use are ""it is included along with your plan"", ""it is free"", ""it is a special offer for new customers"" etc. They particularly take advantage of consumers whose first language is not English and are new to the country. International students are a big mark for them. For instance, a phone plan that would normally set you back by 80 dollars a month, consumers end up paying $120, cause they include headphones, screen protectors , cases etc which the consumer thinks they are getting for free. If i were to buy Vodafone, I would buy it from their online store and not go to the retail store at all. Once again, the network and data speed is reliable and great. Just be careful if you walk into their retail stores.",2
How to profit from COVID without providing ANY CUSTOMER SERVICE,"Yes it is COVID-19 crazy times and of course, there is an increased demand for customer service, from customers wanting to upgrade to unlimited data, some wanting to talk about payment plans etc. As a result I believe Vodafone has had an increase in business. Unfortunately they haven't chosen to employ more staff to cope with this influx, or even with complaints. I have spent 2hrs 40 minutes on hold last week to be told in a repeated message over and over again what issues qualify for Vodafone to actually offer service. And although our request couldn't be dealt any other way then by talking with someone and qalifies, we are unable to get in touch with anyone, over the phone or by email. I eventually hung up. We have upgraded to NBN connection which was set up within a few days, unbelievable, but too bad that our modem and SIM card package was stuck at a courier depot, Vodafone having on record an incorrect house number that doesn't exist. We have called TOLL who had the package at their warehouse and were waiting on Vodafone's instructions - after we updated our house number with TOLL and Vodafone online. The package has now been returned to Vodafone who haven't contacted TOLL. Luckily my partner is very IT savvy and spent the few hours he has for himself after working crazy hours to repurpose an old modem and troubleshoot connection drop off issues. Otherwise we would still be using the old 4G plan which would have run out of data and which would have meant I couldn't work home. But... wait WE ARE still using the old plan. That's right - we are unable to tell Vodafone ""Despite your lack of service, despite our NBN modem being in postal limbo, we have a working NBN connection no thanks to you, and we don't need 2 plans!"" We are being charged for both and unable to cancel direct debit as it would cancel both plans. I know of some companies who are handling COVID a lot better than Vodafone and they are not even profiting from it like Vodafone is. I am gutted that we have had to go with Vodafone, due to lack of option in our area (and yes, cheap plan, when it is not a double charge but forget about the service!). Or other companies who will set up an emergency response call centre in case of, well emergencies. Not Vodafone, NO.",1
Worst service,"Its been 75 days and still am paying for the phone i never received. Stupid company doesnt have a fng bcp. Cant reach, but they csn xontinur with the direct debit. Cant wait to move to a service who has their servixe centres in australia.",1
A better network,"I have been with Vodafone for a few years now, I have 2 mobile numbers, an iPad contract and my NBN recently. They are getting better in providing customer service, much better network and reliable NBN provider.",4
Worst provider,"Customer service is non existent. Constantly having issue calling landline, receiver is unable to hear us clearly. We have a business plan with them but never receive adequate business support (even before Covid). Now Covid is being used as a reason for every single fault on their end. The only saving grace is the $5/day roaming plan, but seeing that international travel is limited this year, I'll be switching providers.",1
Did someone say customer service !!,"I know we have the Covid19 that has thrown a spanner in the works everywhere HOWEVER, I didn't think that would mean, LOYAL PAYING CUSTOMERS would be left out in the cold and not be able to contact Vodafone by ANY of their channels, live chat is missing in action and when it does finally appear no one answers you, phone calls are not being answered by anyone, compliments and complaints are not even being answered, I sent a complaint via my vodafone account and I got an email instantly back saying.....Thank you for your email, however we are assisting urgent cases first, and please call one of these numbers...well I HAVE called one of these numbers and got the same message...we are giving priority to urgent calls......I am not at all happy because even those of us that are not urgent still require assistance, I have been with Vodafone for many years but after this, I have since googled and found many other providers I can go with that are also cheaper than what I am paying per month now, in all reality I have been trying to get through to Vodafone for more than a few weeks now, it's been months and seriously how many more urgent calls are out their after this time and if they haven't or can't get on top of all these urgent calls then they are not running their call centre efficiently, so someone go give them a hand to get on top of all these urgent calls so the rest of us aren't left out in the cold who also need help.",1
Maybe hire more people for your call center?,Before you sign up for a new service. Try calling their call center first and see how long they take to pick up your call.,1
simple question to ask,simple question to ask how does one activate a service where you spend 90 minutes on the phone trying to activate? Oh ok we live in the times of COVID 19 you have to he patient your request is not a priority. Still ok to take a person's money and not he able to service such a service,1
I rang Vodafone to activate my new SIM card to find out the activation code was invalid. Wasted my money and time.,"Purchased a Vodafone SIM card, rang to activate to find out the activation code was invalid. Wasted a lot of my money and my time. Will never deal with Vodafone again",1
This is the worst network I've dealt with.,Constantly being disconnected on a daily basis to the internet.,1
Not a Good service. Poor Connection. They have bogus Customer service. International roaming is worst. Please stay away,"I have missed many opportunities in the past due to poor Connection when I was looking for job or going for an interview.I have experienced very bad connectivity and Customer service while on International roaming.Currently I am facing connectivity issue at my workplace. Same problem occurred in my previous employment.I have called many times to the customer service, I am not satisfied with the overall performance of the service.",1
Worst reception ever,Best reception youâ€™ll get is two bars with 3G. avoid vodaphone at all costs.,1
Raised new order on Monday. Literally no sales support. Can't speak to anyone about my order. Can't even cancel it...,"Made about 30 different calls to customer service but every option related to sales support or new services hangs up on you ""due to covid-19 we are unable to assist you"". I've now been on hold for 30 mins to speak to customer service for existing customers. I just want to cancel my order... Why continue selling products if you have no ability to manage sales orders, let alone existing customers? This is criminal!",1
Nice customer service and good products,Customer service are always helpful and friendly with any issues. Coverage in rural areas isnt amazing but its good otherwise. Prepaid recharges are decent value and plans are also pretty good.,4
Love my new phone,"Got the new iPhone 11 Max Pro. Upgraded online via the myvodaphone app, got the phone the next day. They also called for security to make sure I was the phone who purchased it. Great quick service",5
Bill Issue,"I have been trying to get a service removed from my bill since late last year, while they keep crediting it and telling me it will be removed next bill, it is still appearing. I go into a physical shop, they are unable to help, i call up I am put on hold due to prioritising due to covid-19, I have been trying to get this fixed since last year, where is my priority! First time vodafone customer, last time customer, cant wait to end of contract.",1
on hold for 2.5 hours and still waiting for urgent assistance!,I am currently on hold with Vodafone to fix my connection issues. Due to COVID-19 they are only assisting urgent Enquiries. Mine is classified as urgent. The voice over announcement  said there would be approx a 45 minute wait. It has now been 2 and a half hours that I have been on hold and I am still waiting for Vodafone to take my call. This is ridiculous and unacceptable.  I had to make a similar call with Optus yesterday and waited a maximum of 30 minutes.  Vodafail! Customer support should be brought back to Australia.,1
"The service is crap, heaps of mistakes for simple thing","I went to Vodaphone city store around 11 April , simple upgrade pocket wi-fi to another plan, then the staff made a mistake to put the wrong plan in pocket wi-fi; today 20 April I went to Innaloo store to correct, but instead of correcting pocket wi-fi, the staff made another mistake to change my mobile plan, which means I have to pay 20% more than I supposed to, Waste my time!",1
I love Vodafone,I can't understand the bad reviews here.  Vodafone are great!  Vodafone are really good and helpful and have given free minutes during Covid 19. They have always been helpful and obliging :-) I have never had drop outs or problems.,5
worst signal,just one signal even in central business district.and it happens very often now.please improve your quality if network or wait for the worst as it wont work very long.act now.,1
Vodafone,I went in store and ordered a new phone to begin a plan and I received the phone but not the sim? Am I suppose to buy my own?? X,5
Avoid!,"Next to no service for six months. Technical support processes created a loop of me chasing them and then them chasing me - completely incapable of making any progress. Made unnecessarily difficult to get a refund on the pay-as-you-go service I was using. Kept trying to blame the phone, but service has been fine since I changed to Telstra.",1
No NBN and still waiting,We bought a new Vodafone modem hoping they'll be better than Telstra. We need an installation to get set up and I booked one last week for today and they simply didn't show up. I've heard nothing back from Vodafone and I've been on hold with the call center for ever now with no answer. When they answer I will probably cancel the whole thing and stay with Telstra. Vodafone is a joke.,1
"Nastiest company ever. ""nbn"" works like dog crap.","I would rather crap in my hands and clap than endure another day of their crappy internet that cuts out twice every hour. If I'm paying for THE top plan, I expect it to work without dropping out every 2 seconds. And when it does work, it's a quarter of the promised speed. Sort your crap out you incompetent imbeciles. I'm pretty sure all the people working at vodafone all have too many chromosomes. Avoid vodafone at all costs",1
Dissatisfied disabled,"I rang up Vodafone on behalf of my disabled husband to get heâ€™s phone unblocked as he went  with someone else and was told that itâ€™s not an emergency, well hello he cannot make calls if needed in this carona virus situation,so tell me what is an emergency,I myself will be leaving vodaphone when my contract is up later this year",1
I cant recharge my credit. They will let me buy data add ons but I cant make calls. After 20 mins on hold they hang up.,Poor service but it used to be cheap. Cant even recharge for days now. No calls or SMS at all. They will only sell data. Pre paid plans cannot be recharged currently,1
Paid bills for 2 days which was equal to a month bill also disconnected add-ons but was still getting bills,You can see in the image below I got bill for 2 days at the beginning of starting my service with vodafone and again got the bill later for a month starting after that 2 days bill. Tried to contact and explain with support team but they are not ready  to take their mistake. I gave up and never called them back to resolve it.,1
Excellent service,"Husband needed a new phone. We went to the Malvern store, customer service assisted in picking, explained all the features and even transferred all the photos and contacts to the new phone. They even put me on a better plan. Iâ€™m really happy.",5
WAS GOOD AT THE START NOW CRAP,"Moved to Vodafone from Optus as was crap kept saying new towers and upgrades to existing towers to improve service date kept changing every time one called tech supportThen got on one staff member who told the truth and no idea of up grades and new tower Optus did not care about their customers and now Vodafone is the sameOver loading the towers and systemJust bad luck if you can't get service or the call cuts out and takes many times to re connect call again and that is in most areasCall Vodafone just to be told a lot of crap placed on hold and transfer
Then told that they will call back 
Don't hold your breath then you need to call back and start again 
Have admitted that they have problems 
As have given some credit 
But not enough for the bad service ",1
"Cannot activate, cannot refund, was told it was a forfeit","I purchased 50 prepaid SIM card valued at $50 each on 2017. I clearly told your staff that it was for reselling purpose for an university welcome program and it must be activated internationally. And your staff confirmed that it could be fully refunded if not sold. However, there was problem about activating the cards internationally. I went back to the store but was told by the manager that it could not be refunded as the previous staff was not properly trained. I requested a confirmation re the receipt of my incident report via email by the manager on October, 2017. 

I was also told that the SIM card showed expired and could not be activated, while they are all officially sealed without any indication that it has an expiry date (the recent version has but the old version don't). Your store staff told me that it was a forfeit. I could not understand that while not any sign (neither orally nor show on the product) mentioned it could expire, and none of the product was used in any way, but I need to pay full price for them.


Store location: Vodafone in Canberra Centre
Manager name: Richard Usher",1
It is a disgrace that a telecommunications company Cannot be contacted,"I have been with Vodafone (Hutchinson, 3G, Orange, etc) for 20 years.My friend and I have same phones, and similar plans.I have been on my current plan for over 12 months, and due to a mistake by a Voda employee, they had to start a fresh plan a few months ago(A few months ago I rang Voda, with authority to act on my friends behalf, to make changes to his plan. The Voda employee did all the changes but to the wrong account. We managed to undo most of the damage, but due to Voda's tight rules they had to restart my plan)I now wish to change my plan to their very cheapest.
If i try to do it online they are going to charge me $70 early exit fee, which I should not have to pay, since it was their mistake that forced a restart of my plan.
It is impossible to speak to anyone, and there is no live chat
I am about to cancel my direct debit, in the hope that they will get in touch when the next direct debit is attempted.
It is a disgrace that a telecommunications company cannot be contacted",1
Vodafone refuse to disconnect my number.,"So far ,I've asked customer service 3 separate times to disconnect my voda prepaid number and still they refuse to do so because their customer service people use my number..there's a JAMAL sharing ownership of my number..I've had lots of calls from businesses asking for Jamal. Every time i get a new voda number this happens...",1
Still waiting,We have had no nbn connection for around 4 days - have spent many hours on hold with vodaphone who havenâ€™t fixed the problem (advice has basically been to turn everything off and on! - who would have thought of that?) Now weâ€™re waiting for a technician to call us back - 30 hours and counting.,1
Their website is always under maintaining,"I have been with this mobile provider since 2009. Now, I really get frustrated with their website and mobile app. so difficult to login. It's getting worse. Even if you just want to look at some simple information of their products. Always says, weâ€™ll be back online soon.Weâ€™re currently updating our site with scheduled improvements. Please check back soon.",1
I Am Not Happy With The Service Iv Recently Experienced.,"Iv Been With Vodaphone For Many Years And They Generally Look After Me.. But Iv Recently Called Up To Inquire About The Iphone 12 And I Had Been Waiting On The Phone For 20 Minutes Before I Was Connected, The Lady I Spoke To Was A AssholeAnd Was Rude.I Want To Change Providers I Will No Longer Continue To Stay With Vodafone.If Vodafone Want To Contact Me To Get This Issue Sorted Out You Can Contact Me On,0406 168 533",1
Cannot cancel post-paid phone plan as I am low priority,"I called them yesterday, and according to their initial phone message ""they will only attend to high priority issues"" and mine was not one of them. After going through some steps, yes that's what the auto-phone message said ""good bye"". I went online there is no option. I went to Vodafone store below my apartment, they said they cannot cancel phone connections and they themselves are frustrated as even online chat is not working. So what am I supposed to do, pay for April bill because I am stuck with them? I thought companies like Vodafone are making profits in these times when customers need phone and Internet and they are acting like victims and have shut down their service.",1
There is no way to cancel your plan with VODAFONE unless you call them 10 times,"last week I've contacted vodafone, applied for NBN and I asked them to cancel my vodafone Pocket WIFI ($15/month) because I dont need it any more. They told me DONT WORRY, wait for your nbn modem to arrive, then give us a call and we will cancel your pocket wifi asap. Ive received my modem on Monday and since then I'm calling Vodafone, lines are busy, they dont put me through. Ive visited 3 vodafone stores asking them to cancel my plan but they all said this can be done just over the phone! there is no online or In-store cancellation. This is absolutely a rip off, unethical and very very frustrating. they are literally locking down the customers. There is no way out. I just want to cancel 1 plan out of my 3 Vodafone plans and simply I cant do that online or in store. Im very frustrated with their customer service and do not suggest Vodafone to anyone in Australia.",1
Useless mobile app and poor coverage,"Network coverage is pathetic, I constantly loose signal at busy places where everyone else has signal. The mobile app is totally useless, always troubleshooting. Wish I could rate it minus obe",1
Worse internet provider,Vodafone services continue to decline over the years. Itâ€™s been a few Week now that Iâ€™ve been experiencing bad reception. Canâ€™t wait until my plan is over so I can change providers. If youâ€™re looking for a internet provider PLEASE stay clear of Vodafone. Worse service ever,1
"14 years loyal, time to switch.","Vodafone has gone downhill over the years. I have been a loyal customer for 14 years and I get no discount or offers or anything whilst their service and coverage has gotten crappier. The last year with Vodafone has been horrible with constant network drop outs, just generally bad reception and coverage.  I have since moved all of my 3 plans to Amaysim and they are amazing with customer service and deals and quality of coverage it's like day and night.",1
Disgusted,Moving all my Vodafone services else where I got treated like rubbish today no option after being a loyal customer for five years absolutely disgusting and pathetic couldnâ€™t even get connected to an Australian customer service,1
20 Years loyalty means ZERO,Overall ordinary coverage but average 3G coverage but meant to be 4G/5G in Sydney .,1
The worst network ever!!!,"I just switched to Vodafone coz they had really good deals and they are cheaper than other networks. But seriously their network coverage is so bad. I m in Melbourne and they donâ€™t have good network in major suburban areas...like Footscray, sunshine, even Docklands. If you go further down towards the western suburbs, it gets even worse. I am definitely switching my network providers. Never going to back to Vodafone again, everrr!!",1
They attempted in charging me some bills which were paid 4 months ago and it's nor a satisfying company to deal with.,Legal scammers they have attempted in trying to charge some bills which were paid 4 months ago and it's a horrible company with the worst receptions.kind regards author & SM Influencer,1
Terrible Terrible Terrible,"Worst ever service We are currently receiving from Vodafone, In my house maximum speed I can get is only 1 Mbps, Can not able to download any app and sometimes not even open a single page.",1
Very bad customer service,My phone is playing up and took to the shop for 5 times and they sent it away came back just with software update and still have problems and also more problems,1
Always used this provider for my phone plans,"I have always used this provider for my mobile phone plans. The network coverage is usually reliable. Download speeds have always been good especially where i live, i sometime prefer using it than my home WiFi which is with a different provider.",4
Vodafone uses Aus Post Records to verify addresses...Aus post records can by wrong!!,"Hi""We've suspended your service as we havent been able to confirm your address details. Please call us on 155 ...etc etc.

HOw absolutely charming (

A nicer note of ""Please update your details otherwise we will have to suspend your service....

Bottom Line""    Aussie post delivers very little to me ...I have a PO Box for all my parcels cos unless its from Kogan, Internnode  one of the big accounts OR a Passport ....they just dont deliver stuff to  the home addy.

Vodafone uses Aussie Pose to verify physical addresses.
I gave Vodafone my physical address
Ausie Post said they didnt recognise it.......
Frightening eh?
Major source of verification doesnt have correct records.


Ayway I got Vodafone to put BOTH my addresses on record.

No chance of talking to Corporate or someone who really cares about the long term outcomes of such glitches.

Interestingly I cannot put anything on Aus Post website OR even on one of the FBchat rooms ....but will put it on here too .

Hope this perhaps gives you an idea of how the verification process could have gone wrong for you.
Good Luck.",5
Cancel wifi pocket modem plan,I wanted to cancel my plan but was transferred to six different departments. Should be an easy process vodafone. Not happy and a waste of my time. Also made me enter all my details every single time I was transferred. Annoying!,1
Network is very poor,Itâ€™s frustrating. I am struggling while writing this review itself with the network.I called them an complained and the answer was wait till another month till they will come up with something. Itâ€™s good that my plan is about to expire.,1
Roaming is atrocious,I am a vodafone UK customer and have found the vodafone Aus roaming data to be incredibly bad. Not sure if this is regulated to stop me using my data. It says I am 4G+ but seems more like dial up from 20 years ago.Sort it out Vodafone.,1
Good first time option,"Arriving from another country, the first thing you would look for is a reliable mobile network. Good thing they are the first you see in the exit of the arrivals, and yeah they will register you and all so no hassle. I just find that they are some areas where signal is limited. But overall great job!",4
Worst company In the history,"I want Vodafone to explain to me why there network service is so VERY VERY BAD compared to absolutely everyone else , I want compensation for my anger & frustration and the 4 mobile phones Iâ€™ve smashed to bits from being so enraged by the fact Iâ€™ve got to basically grab hold of a satellite to use the internet",1
AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!!,Couldn't use my network due to constant drop outs (7 times 1 call) unreliable internet. No compensation but a $250 bill will be taking matter further.AVOID company at all costs,1
My Vodafone down for weeks,"I am trying to get a copy of my last bill, but My Vodafone has been down for weeks and the call centre cant provide anymore info other than ""yes it is down"". They then proceed to change the subject. Cant print out any bills or see of my charges. Yet hold me to paying a post paid bill by the due date of which I cant see what I am being charged for. They are criminals.",1
Signal problems getting worse,"I moved from Telstra to Vodafone based on better value on the plan. I own my mobile outright and was after a SIM only. The first 12 months were fine, not the greatest reception in the CBD but that is expected. However the last 4 months there have been constant problems with reception. I can barely use the internet on my phone, there a constant lags, and over the past few weeks phone calls and text messages are not being received. I know this because my friends and family have shown me proof they tried to call and text, but nothing is on my phone call log at all. Unfortunately Vodafone have not been able to assist, and since the SIM plan is no longer fit for purpose I will be returning to Telstra. They may be more expensive but at least I know it works.",1
Worst Customer Service EVER!,"Terrible service, misguided and costed me a prepaid plan which didn't offer the same amount of data as staff claimed. Wasted 1 hour on the phone! never trust voda, you're better off with another provider.",1
27+ years of loyalty doesn't matter to Vodafone.,They treat you like crap and their customer service and reception is quite poor. It takes forever to speak to someone at which time is is hard to understand and they do not follow up on complaints.,1
Vodafone Starter Pack,"Vodafone Starter Pack is rubbish, DONOT buy it unless you know how it works. Purchased the pack from Coles, inserted into my phone, tried to activate but couldn't succeed. After long wait while calling call centre, it came to know that the seller ""Coles"" had to scan both barcodes (which obviously they should know, but they didn't)  and top up additional $10 while purchasing in order to activate, which is NOT mentioned anywhere in the product.

Terrible reception,"Have been with them for over 20 years. Very foolishly. Reception was always bad, and continues to be poor. A few years ago with a dual SIM phone I added an ALDI Sim and couldn't be happier.  Should've  ported my number in the first place but I was unsure whether the Aldi SIM would be any better. I was on a very expensive prepaid with Vodafone and it wasn't until I  made contact that they offered a better plan but still expensive when compared with ALDI. Furthermore, Aldi gives upgrades automatically, no need to ask.  Must admit I am a bit lazy but will port my number to another carrier to get rid of Vodafone after all. I stuck with them hoping they would improve  but alas it hasn't happened nor is it every likely to.",1
"There is no phone company more useless, and that's saying something","Don't assume their website is accurate. They will take your money, and only after they have your cash will they inform you of the truth. Refunds are a huge pain.",1
Terrible company to deal with,"Worst  Phone Provider ever - treated a customer of 15 years with disrespect, the call centre staff was rude and did not know what they were doing, went to the TIO who offered to have direct resolution with Vodafone - but the case officer went in circles and did not offer a solution - waste of time",1
Be aware donâ€™t sign up with vodaphone,I feel that vodaphone have treated a loyal customer of nearly 12 years like me with so much disrespect. I upgraded my plan 9 months ago with a new phone and for the last 9 months I have had nothing but issues. My calls were failing all the time and people were having trouble calling me. The vodaphone network was so bad that I have been paying them for 9 months and have the worse network issues ever. Frequent drop outs and always 1 bar. When I went in to see them they passed the blame to Apple. They tried a few things and it was still the same. I went to Apple and how great was Apple they gave me a new phone even though they said they donâ€™t think the phone is the issue. Thatâ€™s good customer service and this is what vodaphone fails to be good at. After many  calls to them and many times going into the store I still had no resolution. No return calls and nothing. So I decided to go to another provider to try and see if I would still have issues. Iâ€™m with Telstra and have had not one drop out or issues. Vodaphone told me over the phone they would allow me to take my phone back as it was on a contract. Then I was told after 1.5 hours on the phone that I couldnâ€™t. Lies after lies. They spoke to me like I was a nobody after that long being a loyal customer and never once being behind in my bill. What a shame!!! Vodaphone isnâ€™t loyal they donâ€™t care about their customers. Do the right thing. I will be going to the ombudsmen and I will never return as a customer or will any of my friends and family.,1
"Mobile Broadband, started well, went badly, ended on a real bad note","Signed up for a 12 month plan for mobile broadband $60/monthAsked about overages, told I would get alerts and could just stop it.Kids used the internet and took me over a few early months.Contacted vodafone to ask for a way to CAP the usage and just stop the account at the 100Gb limit, explained that paying $10 per Gb seemed like a rip offVodafone just said they send the alerts, use those to be in control myself. Disappointing.Fast-forward to month 12.em 0/10 that I would not recommend, explained the above reasons: the ripoff price for overages, the inability to cap the usage and their desire to slap additional charges on even for just a few Mb over. I also specifically asked for someone to contact me and confirm what my contract end date was. 

I didn't realise it was then in January. Over Christmas my kids again had turned the modem on again and gone over for another 2Gb, $20 wasted. Okay, that's a parenting issue, but means I call Vodafone to check on the end date, it was last month, the roll date was the 23rd, 2 days ago, so now I owe them another $60 for Jan to 22nd of Feb for a service I'm out of contract, do not want, and told them to contact me about in early Jan.",1
"No contract sent, wrong discount, no credit for trade in phone and rude customer service team","BUYER BEWARE!!! I traded in my old phone last year and got a new plan from Vodaphone Redbank Plains.  The guy who did the transaction said he will send a copy of the contract to me. He was on his own and was very busy so I agreed. He never did. I went to the shop today and found out my discount has been applied incorrectly. Asked the guy for a copy of the contract to be emailed to me, he said he couldnâ€™t find it online. He doesnt know why it wasnt sent to me but he says itâ€™s nowhere to be found. Then I asked about the phone I traded in and he said to check with the customer service team. He was rude and unhelpful so I decided to leave and call their team instead.
I spoke to their phone team only to find out there was no record of the trade in happening. I spoke to Mario and his manager Nuddasir. They couldnâ€™t help me further. In fact, it felt like everyone wanted to palm me off to a different team. I have been asked to go back to the branch to prove that I gave them the phone. Now the onus is on the customer to prove that the transaction happened and get what is due to us. If I did not keep a transcript of my discussion with their chat team about my discount, I would not have gotten that discount either because they kept on pushing back. Now how is that for honesty, accountability and transparency, Vodaphone?

FYI- while I was there, the guy called someone else and he started talking in his own language!

No thanks for longtime loyalty,"12 years Iâ€™ve been with Vodafone, Iâ€™ve always upgraded at the 2 year mark and signed for another 2 years and my bills are always paid on time.  Last upgrade they matched what Optus were offering, this time around I got accused of essentially not being truthful with what Optus were offering and they wouldnâ€™t match Optus. The plan they wanted me to go on was much more than my current plan and they wouldnâ€™t let me continue my current plan and just get a new phone, they wanted me to go on a higher plan with 4 x more data than I currently have that I donâ€™t even use all of. 12 years of loyalty, never missed a bill payment and was told they didnâ€™t believe me and they couldnâ€™t match Optus price (which is a whole $1.50 per month cheaper) even though they have in the past. At the end of the call the agent even offered to close down my account for me then and there.

 Iâ€™m off to pick up my new phone tonight that will not be with Vodafone obviously.
Vodafone used to be very competitive, definitely not anymore and Iâ€™ll never go back to them after the way I was spoken to by vodafone",1
Just got ripped off on a deal at Vodafone Neutral Bay. I was accused of dishonesty. Will NEVER use again.,"Just terrible.  After agreeing to a trade in price on the old Iphone 7+ we did the deal.  Right at the end of the process after everything done I was told they would no longer take the old phone and we would not be credited the trade in price of $220 due to screen issues.  Also told that it was too late for me to back out of the deal  and I could not give the new phone back to them. If they had rejected the old phone straight away I would have understood but to do it afte the transfer of all info and already handing over the new phone is just WRONG.  ""[name removed]' the sales person was just rude and dismissive.  It was even suggested that I had in some way damaged the old phone between when it was first seen (2 days) and when we went back in to pick up the new phone despite them taking the old phone when well before the end of the process because they had to exchange all the info into the new phone from it.  Coverage already seen to be worse than my old Amaysim plan.",1

Just a merry go round with technical team with their lips service and bully tactics! For reasons beyond my control, I am still stuck with Vodafone against my free will!! Will lodge a complain to the Ombudsman! 

If you value your health!! Stay clear of Voda as they are really hopeless and a stressful experience!!",1
Basic incompetence,"Let me tell you about my ongoing frustration with this useless company.  Every time I come back to AustraliaI have ongoing issues with their service.  Here is my current experience.  I went into the store in World square in Sydney to get a sim card.  I showed my passport.  The man in the store (the shorter asian man) told me that my passport wasn't enough ID.  He made me go back to my hotel and get my medicare card.  On returning, the other gentleman who served me (the other guy was busy) told me that my passport was enough.  Of course I asked why I was sent back to my hotel.  Then, my phone is connected and at no point did they give me a pin.  This means that I could not easily get through to vodafone.  I was promissed two days ago that someone would call.  They never did.  I just tried to get through three times but without a PIN it kept disconnecting to me.  I finally get through and to access my account they needed to confirm my passport number.  I read it out and the rep said that it was not right and that she could not access my account.  She told me to go into a store.  Well without a car that means that I would have to get a bus and pay for that.  For what??? Because the incompetent person in the store put in the wrong passport number.  Seems that's just a very difficult thing to do.  Every time I call customer service I get Indian men who are very very very rude and quite patronizing.  I do not know why I continue to bang my head against a wall and use this USELESS company.  Seriously.  I am in shock that Vodafone is this incompetent.  My brain cannot process this.  Now I need to go in to a store and show my passport which is what I used as ID to open the account.  Just disgusting!",1
Don't recommend Vodafone. Dodgy practises. Poor coverage.,"Don't recommend Vodafone. Consultant scammed me over the phone into agreeing to sign a contract for 36 months when i specifically said 24. All for comission. This is with Fair trading. No mail or email sent. Cheaper and more reliable telcos out there. Left after 10 years and won't evet go back. Unreliable in many areas, especially south west sydney. Vodafone lies about upgrades to towers. Download speed is sufficient when they actually have coverage. Would strongly not recommend. Networks that use telstra lines are significantly better.",1
A total ripoff company,"Vodafone has charged me $1000 for using internet for 10 Minutes in Qatar, while travelling.

Fake advertisement.",1
Data speed is the worst,"Data speed wise, its a ripoff. There were times I couldn't open a basic webpage and speed can be really really slow, even in sydney CBD. If you are looking for even a basic internet speed data plan, avoid Vodafone. What is the point of more data if you cannot even open a simple page when you need it. I had to reset network setting frequently just to make it work. I was never able to update any apps in iphone just because the download speed was so bad. Once I switched to Telstra , I realized how bad vodafone is for data speed. I would have given it -10 negative ratings if I could.",1
Horrible Network!,Currently travelling through Australia I can't believe I renewed a plan with Vodafone. $120 a month for horrible coverage. Don't make the same mistake I did. The worst coverage you can imagine.,1

They did not inform me there was any problem and when I rang a week later they wouldn't help me and told me I had to go into a Vodafone stall to sort it out. It is inconvenient for me to try and get to a store but they refused to help over the phone. I can see this also happened to the person below. They tried to tell me over the phone it was some kind of protection for my safety and that they had informed me, but I never received any message from Vodafone!",1

Hell, they even sent this phone to some place in Victoria (probably one of their scammer buddies) despite me completing several ID checks and my efforts telling them that I never ordered this phone. When I rang Pakistan or India or someplace there they told me I had to fill out a fraud form. I have to fill out a form because one of their employees is scamming me ?? I have contacted the telecommunications ombudsman. If you speak Indian Pakistani and not English then vodafone is for you!! Beware of this Telco they are full of scammers and fraudsters. Never do business with them.",1
Illegal termination charges and automatically billing me $5 per day without notifying me.,"I paid off my phone and switched to a month-to-month plan.

Customer service rubbish,Tried to transfer my daughters SIM from pay as you go to post pay SIM.

Now have to visit Vodafone store because of incompetence of offshore call centers. Never again will I call there support numbers.,1

Poor customer service,"I had a fraud claim, in which someone opened a Vodafone account in my name. I lodged a fraud claim as required. That was a waste of time, as Vodafone ended up stating that I'm liable to pay off the fraudulent account! Can't they investigate the person who opened the account! So I'm now going to have to pay for something I didnt use! I don't even have an account with them! Is this how big Corporations treat the poor!",1
Worst Customer Service,"Worst customer service I've had at Vodafone.  Super ignorant attendant, literally had no training or no knowledge on how to treat a customer.  It did not solve my problem and even in front of client made neglect with a lady who could not understand what he was talking about.  Just to point out, I called the online service and solved my problem in 5 minutes, which the Vodafone Glenelg(South Australia)employee couldn't.

Firstly, their English speaking is incomprehensible and they are inefficient in handling and understanding how to deal with issues.

I had a hardship case after domestic violence and was told by the operator that females ask for it and that doesn't mean I could change my plan or pay out my phone early. Another call let me pay out my contract but I was told I had to pay an additional $165 on top of my early termination fee. This $165 then showed up as credit in my future invoices for a closed account. To get this refund Vodafone wants your full bank statements (you are not allowed to black things out). I consulted the TIO and still don't have my refund, even though I sent the statement. Horrible company to deal with.",1

customer service is failing them. Receiving a polite runaround is only good customer service in foreign call centre.,"Our plans are up, the plans have changed, and will be needing new phones. Been researching online looking at plan options and phones, Customer service just lies and tries to push you into a new phone. last 6 months only had Indian call center answer phone. In one case they put me on hold, and 10 minutes later they came back with answers about a streaming service i don't have. The misrepresent facts just to get sales, and don't care if they're screwing you politely.  Several times after making calls was contacted by telemarketer trying to sell crypto trading within 10 minutes.
Went to southland store and a very helpful girl of anglo-saxon nature, was intrested in helping, not pushing a product.
My wife ended up choosing a phone that was popular and not in stock, back order due next week. They signed all papers and we left all happy again. Received a message to say had been delayed, still happy.
Nothing for nearly 2 weeks, and the night we discussed she would go to the store the next. At 9:30 at night (asleep now) I received a message from toll to say the the phone would be delivered tomorrow between 8am and 8pm. Canceled some work, and payed someone to fill in for rest of work, so as to be there for delivery. Nothing. There is no number to call the store and customer service script dill tells you to call the store. The shopping center office gives the number of the store, but its under Indian control, and there is an Indian voice telling to call customer service number. Only went you ask to cancel the contract of undelivered products, and insist, do they transfer you to a local person who locates the product. Still wont tell you the store phone number. The drive will be 20- 40 depending. Hope they didn't lie !!!
Still thinking of cancelling.
This is an overseas operated company. I deliberately dealt with a Vodafone store, not a franchise.
The should change their name to foreign phone.",1
Poor network coverage and poor services,"Apart from the issues with Vodafone's poor network coverage and call drops, their services are worst in this region. I got a call from their customer care executive and they said they are discontinuing my ongoing existing plan which was under contract for 12 months. I am almost forced to quit my existing ongoing plan\contract to materialize new contract again for 12 months and new plan is really a very bad plan compared to what I was using. May be it is their strategy to trap people this way by extending their contracts again for another 12 months, because otherwise I don't think an existing customer would like to continue with Vodafone for their poor network and services. It is highly unlikely that I will continue with Vodafone in future.",1
Not as happy as I thought Id be,Is not the best service! I get little to no service in my house and customer service team sound like they read everything off a manual!They continually tell me for 4yrs that they are fixing or putting up a tower in my area and my service will improve. The service has never improved. We are looking around for another service as its pointless paying for something that I never get to use!,2
Poor reception,"Vodafone is by the worst carrier out there,there reception is appalling just about every location i go i cant get a signal or the speed is 3 mbps,the rest of family is with telstra and they kick butt when it comes to reception and speed,cant wait to pay out my device payout and pack my bags.",1

On the expected shipping date of 11 Oct, I was given yet another shipping date of 18 Oct. Called them again and now they say they cant do anything because of delays from Apple, which is an obvious lie because every other provider (Telstra, Optus) and even stores JB-Hi-Fi, Officeworks has all colours and memory options available for next day delivery.",1
Poor ordering experience,"I placed an order with vodafone for a new handset which had a delivery estimate of 1-2 days within order approval, which changed to 2-3 weeks once the order was approved. It shouldnâ€™t have affected me as i placed an order when it was 1-2 days, clearly their website doesnt take into account the stock they have and they take orders blindly. I ordered on 22/09/2019 and i waited till 9/10 (which was my expected dispatching date). I checked with them today on 10/10/2019 and they said they dont have any stock at all and the waiting time is 4-6 weeks. After waiting for 20 days, I cancelled the order.",1
horrible customer service,"I discovered an overcharge in my September bill and filed a complaint. A staff emailed me and said that he raised an investigation with their billing team and would get back to me as soon as he had news.Then nothing happened since then, and I had thought that the mistake was corrected.ack within 10 days. 
What would they expect me to reply to the previous email when they promised to reply to me with an answer? 

So the Vodafone's approach to customer complaints is to give a fake promise to investigate, wait for 10 days, and then close the case - problem solved - how genius this is!",1
Over charging no responses to complaints,"I signed up with Vodafone $40 sim plan and $69 nbn plan. They did set up the nbn quite quick and the internet seems to be working well however, I am now being charged almost $200 each time when the bills should be $109 for both per month.",1
Poor Network in Westmead Hospital,No network coverage inside Westmead Child Hospital. No outgoing & incoming. Looks this is specific to Vodaphone only. Other service provider like Lyca & Optus has no issue. Simply rubbish. Donâ€™t recommend,1

After thinking I finalized which phone I have to go , then I called again back on 00/03/2019 and spoke with one your another executive ( his name was [name removed] -donâ€™t know whether its his original name or not) and after the confirmation of stock I selected the red colour and place the order , as I also explained before selecting that I need this phone before 8th of October as I have to give present to my wife on her birthday , I was happy about that , but today on 03/10/2019 I received the message from vodafone that they donâ€™t have stock and I will receive the stock by 19/10/2019 , which stressed me out and then I called Vodafone , I spoke with [name removed] ( one of the executive) but he said he cant help me, then I spoke with the supervisor ( his name was [name removed]) and explained , he also cant helped me with this , 
I am surprised that nobody can help me, I am also working in tyre industry we also having issues like this but we will drill it down and always support our customer ( specially the old customer) , why they not thinking out of the box , how is this possible that you donâ€™t have single piece in all over Australia , even if Vodafone try to help the customer then they can check the stock outside Australia and delivered to Melbourne but no â€“ as Vodafone not bother about their customer , they donâ€™t want to help their customer , they donâ€™t care about customer emotions, 

As Vodafone play with my emotions â€“ which make me decided to move on another mobile services ( may be another company phone not I Phone) and breaking the relationship with Vodafone which I am having with them  from last 10 years, ",1
Outstanding service,"I went in to Vodafone Forest hill yesterday to upgrade my kids iPhones to the iPhone 11 pro max . The information in relation to the discounts / trade in ect was excellent . The staff member (# L1143 ) sorry forgot his name , was so friendly , knowledgable and helpful . We have had our 3 services with Vodafone for many years and will of course continue to do so. Thanks so much to this lovely staff member .Suzie P",5
Do not trust! Will lie to get you to sign contract and then renege on the offer,"Customer care and in-store staff will promise you discounts while signing up to a new deal, and then take these away. Follow up customer service is horrendous; being told different stories and promises made and not delivered on. Avoid.",1
"Low cost, low coverage",Been with Vodaphone for a long time.  Very happy with their metro coverage but as soon as I am out of Perth they do not have coverage.  I thought by now they would have got their act together.,3
Vodafone service and coverage getting worse,"It used to be very good. In fact I was with Vodafone for almost 10 years. However, i started experiencing network issues since last year even in city limits at times. The quality of sales calls have also dropped significantly. They used to be very good in the past. Iâ€™m not sure whatâ€™s changed, but Iâ€™ve decided to look for other options. There are better deals and coverage, my wife was also with Vodafone and moved to Belong. They have much better coverage and value for money. I recommended Vodafone in the past. However wouldnâ€™t be doing it any more.",2
Five Star,Have no issues with coverage - actually have more than my partner who's with Telstra most times. Speed is always good too. Service is always outstanding and competitive pricing for what is offered. Have been with Vodafone approximately 10 years and have no desire to change.,5
"Worst network, worst customer service","I was having so so much of problems with their poor network that I decided to move to Telstra(which is the best thing i did).They still charged my account incorrectly after promising that I donâ€™t have to pay anything now.Now i have been struggling for weeks and weeks just to get the refund back to my account.Have called them so many times, they always promise to process the refund this time and that never happens. By the way each call means around an hour of my time.Havenâ€™t got the refund yet, check the below screenshot and see how they fool the customers.",1
The coverage is getting worse,Vodafone was okay but the network is getting worse. I can not even get a 4G network consistently. After this sim plan contract finish will definitely move to other service provider,2
Bundles,"I have 4 services bundled with Vodafone getting 15% of each service,you need 5 services to get 20%,I tried to add another son who is a very wealthy from a car accident that left him quadriplegic and was denied.Fair dikum bunch of knobs that I'm stuck with now,you will do better elsewhere.",1
It's ok,"It's ok but I won't suggest to another member of my family because they're charging too much and even didn't explain or refund me. When I call asking lots of question, It just waste of my time.",2
Bad service,"I'm on $45 plan and every month send me bill 60-85   always add some extra services and blame your customers. Only SIM plan not even lock in contract, Avoid avoid Vodafone crap service and network. Shane on. Never recommend anyone.Greedy",1
Customer Service Reps who clearly hate their jobs,"Went into Vodafone Burwood to help a friend with her prepaid account. Shes new to the country so wanted some help with what would be the best option for her. We asked the customer rep who was clearly free. As soon as we requested what we were after, she seemed disinterested, walked off without saying anything (which baffled us a bit), then came back with a piece of paper, saying ""here are the options, pick whatever you want"". I later found out from my friend who used to work for Vodafone that its because she wouldn't make any money out of us, the money would be in signing up new customers. 

Whatever the reason, she clearly just didn't care. As we asked questions, her response was basically, ""well up to you"". Anyway, she puts the transaction through without confirming. (We wanted to start the new plan after the old plan ran out), which meant my friend lost left over credit on her old plan. No apology, just ""oh well you guys didn't tell me.""

If you're in Burwood, don't go to ""Suzie"", if that's even her real name. Shes the one with big fake nails, and caked on makeup.",1
New App,"The new ""app"" is absolutely terrible. Haven't been able to use it since the ""upgrade""I can never log on due to technical issues.I'll try it one more time... it sucks!",1
Deceiving customers,"The customer reps would not listen and makes assumptions and conclusions without checking for details.Deceive customers in to buying new plans with false promises. By upgrading my plan, they have really downgraded my plan",1
Very poor,"I want to let everybody know how reprehensible Vodaphone are:1. Dad had a stroke, and his speech was severely affected. Despite this, he continued to be able to remain in contact with family far away. Then,2. The hospital lost his phone, which he continued to ask for, even some weeks later.3. I finally got around to trying to get his bill waived, because he could not do this for himself. After much toing and froing, they agreed not to bill him again. They said it would be a simple matter if he had died.4. They sent yet another bill, despite their promise not to bill him, so I phoned to let them know he has died. STILL not a simple matter! Thank you Telstra for being human when my Mum died, despite her contract not being fully paid.",1
Worst Provider and worst customer service,"I had a 24 month contract with Vodafone and they not only were charging more than everyone else, when my contract ended, I added my wife's number on to it as they said I'll get it for much cheaper. They didn't tell me that they were adding me to another contract.. ANOTHER 12 MONTHS.. And when I moved to optus, after my initial 24 months they charged me 200 for early exit...!!! I called the customer service and they were rude as hell..",1
Would not recommend to anyone.,"Tried to rip me off with double billing for the same period. When called them, some Indian operators argued with me saying they haven't done anything wrong and that I just don't understand the bill. It took me multiple calls to prove them wrong and to get the wrong bill cancelled. They agreed only after I threatened them with Fair Trading. This customer support guys from India are horrible and very rude. I will wait for my contract to finish and mice to another provider",1
"Useless, 100 mbps down to 1 mbps","Connection was good for 1st two months, Now its down to 1 mbps for two days. Backup 3G/4G connection also slowed down to same level. I assume vodafone has two many customers compare to available quota or they tweak the system to slow down, lets wait for few more days",1
From start to finish the worst mobile experience I have had,The staff member I dealt with when purchasing a SIM in store was pushy and aggressively attempted to sell me a more expensive plan despite my making clear that I did not need or want one.,1
What they charge extra for credit card pay,I went for plan they never mention they will charge extra for credit card payments even they charge me upfront within 15 days for whole month and the network 14/7  they said but my call hangs out I have to call back to back to continue conversation  they have con staff just focus more on money then qualityIf you are sensitive and look value of your money never choose Vodafone,1
Ver bad experience with Vodafone customer service.,Ver bad experience with Vodafone customer service. I recently place my order with Vodafone for iPhone 11 pro max but they declined my application telling me that my credit score is declined and told me to go and check credit score with illion. When I checked my credit score with illion site they said That my credit score is good to go. Again I called to Vodafone customer and said that I checked my credit with illion and my score is good and asked them to tell me reason why my credit score is declined and they take rudely and told me that they cannot provide me reason why my application is rejected. Very bad service provided by Vodafone,1
Warning Don't get Vodafone NBN,Since I signed up with Vodafone I have had nothing but trouble I'm on the so called fastest NBN and I cant even watch Netflix without it buffering I only have 2 smart phones and a smart TV using this it should not be this slow but when you ring customer service or technical they keep trying to tell me I'm getting a fast internet speed I say if its that fast why is it buffering all the time when I had less trouble with my adsl when I do a speed test it shows a slow speed of 7mbps when I'm ment to be getting 80 +,1
False misleading advertising of overseas call charges,"I was heading overseas so transferred to Vodafone because they advertise ""use your plan while overseas for $5 a day"". It turned out this is highly misleading advertising (my wife remains with them) sends an SMS when entering each new country indicating receiving SMSs is always free (so allows the phone to be taken out of flight mode with no charges). The SMS offers an all you can eat $10 daily charge or if you are only going to use the phone briefly (e.g sending one or two SMSs) then you can choose to only pay for what you use. Vodafone do not offer these options 

The conclusion Vodafone's overseas special deal is more expensive than the other carriers

I was so frustrated with Vodafone that on coming home I immediately transferred away. Unfortunately Vodafone then charged me a final bill of $8 to transfer my number! ",1
Need better customer service,"Generally Vodafoneâ€™s okay however when there is an issue I have to speak to someone who cannot speak English, so I can never get an answer to my problems and nothing every gets fixed.",2
Porting out issues because of new security policy!,"So last month I went to activate a new sim & port out from another carrier. Usually it's a simple process but I ended up not knowing what happened when I ended up with their standard prepaid # thinking I ported out wrong.hat there's been a new security policy which I was meant to click a link from my Optus sim first before porting out. Which is ridiculous!

How am I supposed to know if I am using a Vodafone sim & they SMS me on my original number on the other carriers sim & when no emails were sent to me. Apart from an SMS to mention on their Vodafone sim that came through once that the porting of the number is in progress. The live chat team could not even explain to me why the porting wasn't completed until I called! Why not port my number across as well when I called as I had verified who I was.

I've already had to stop using Telstra services because of another issue. Vodafone may be next & I'll be spending my money elsewhere. It used to be a simple process!",1
Bad network ever,"Having a bad network since last week, full signal in 4G but always disconnected and drop out! They only care about what to sale ignored service quality. Never choose this over distended company!",1
very Very bad service - Just need money without any service,Always after money and no coverage.Slow network speed.Unlawful early termination fees.No support and no customer focus.I requested them to release my number but they refused asking me to pay early termination fee which they have implemented without informing me,1
"Vodafone, service coverage is getting worst everyday and your customer service takes an enormous time to answer.","Hi Vodafone, your service coverage is getting worst everyday and your customer service takes a lot and lot and lot of time to answer, phone signal drops all the time and all you can do is to wait for the signal and it is very frustrating when you are talking to important people. Vodafone you really are the worst network. One Unhappy loyal customer here for more than 10 years.",1
Customer Service,"What, used to be a good company, who, consistently used to get full marks from me on surveys, has gone down hill! Have tried to disconnect a service, for 7 days. Call backs never come and when I have spoken with someone, they have not done what I asked. Disconnect a phone number; it's not difficult! One Star.",1
If you need a business account do not use Vodafone!!!!,"I started a business and bought a new phone + new number from Vodafone. The IPhone X I bought is just 6 months old and already has several issues ! Then, the plan...well, their small business approach is absolutely outrageous. I have a personal number with Vodafone and never encountered the problems I do with the business account. Although I am a small business and the amount I owe is $100/month if I fail to pay on the date (which happens in business due to low cash flow) they not only add 10% penalties but also suspend your calls and data after 2 weeks. I have never ever had my personal phone calls suspended even if I was late a month, why am I treated like that just because I am a business?? After you pay the bill they take 48 hrs to unlock the calls!!! Great for a business!!!
Shop elsewhere business owners!!!",1
Donâ€™t trust roaming,"I was led to believe that roaming allowed you to use your phone as if you were in Australia, however please be aware that you donâ€™t get voicemail message notifications nor can you access voicemail as you would in Australia.I missed very important messages when I was away - very frustrating that I wasnâ€™t notified.",2
Changing my mobile was easy,I have used Vodafone for some time and the network coverage was a significant improvement to my last service.  upgrading my mobile in the Wanneroo store was really straightforward and the store member was very helpful. I have now started to use Vodafone for NBN. So far so good,5
Very difficult company to deal with,"Very difficult and unhelpful company. If you can, go to TELSTRA. Did not assist with account consolidation, or phone upgrades. Online staff could not understand spoken English. The text chat line was useless.",1
I love my Vodafone,"I think Vodafone is great, they have pretty good prices and gives you a good amount of mobile data at a reasonable priceCan't complainI've been with them for over 10 years and never had any problems that won't fixed early :)",5
Worst customer Service in the world!,"Poor customer service, asked for a refund. Vodafone was unable ID card used. Requested I provide number to all my cards to find the right card used. Worst ever company",1
The worst one,"I have a lot of mobile data, what is expensive, that actually I canâ€™t use because it never works properly. I live 5km far from Melbourne CBD and it never works at home. I already tried my friends mobile data at home and all of them who donâ€™t use Vodafone have their mobile data working properly. The download speed is 3.1mbps.Regret only.",1
Shocking customer service!,Poor communication and not at all helpful. Very disappointed. I was given the run around for 6 hours yesterday and still no decent outcome. Website is unhelpful and none of the contact numbers are relevant.,1
Hopelessly MOBILE PHONE COVERAGE,You need to fix up your mobile phone coverage is hopeless. Everytime I call the useless call centre it's the same old story line we are doing upgrades to the towers in your location how many times a year can you update and upgrades your mobile phone towers.,1
Changes to My Vodafone,"Vodafone HAD the clearest and easiest to use website, My Vodafone. It was the reason I changed to Vodafone. Last week it was changed. It is now not possible to access My Vodafone on a computer. The only simple thing to find is data usage, everything else is arduous and barely worth the angst. I will give them a month to correct this. Meanwhile my research has started for another Telco.",1
disgusting!,they charge me too early than it should thought paying MONTHLY! then whats this ?first april 23rd i paid straight from my account $57 for monthly  then may 21rst then june 19th and this month is july 17 im so upset about this !i didnt consume all my data coz i off  when i dont need it ..then instead of monthly payment they ask payment to early whats next i have to pay every week ?instead of monthly .?its sad .,1
Slow speed &amp; higher rates,"I have been using Vodafone over 2 years and not happy with the service they provide. Recently, the network slowed down to 1 or 2 Mbs. I called them and they said there is a network issue and would be fixed by the end of the week. However, It has never been fixed and customer representative could not do anything about it.Another fact is that it is much more expensive than other network providers. I would suggest to avoid Vodafone. I am thinking of switching to another provider.",1
Latest email bill in html format and completely unreadable - Customer service just not interested,"Moved my company phones to Vodafone 6 months ago, now I am really regretting it.The latest email bill arrived but it is in html format and completely unreadable with no attached pdf statement.Wasted my time trying to use their awful App to find the amount to payThen called and  customer service just not interested - kept telling me to use the AppCoverage is awful too - sat in Nepean hospital and Optus and Telstra full signal - no signal from Vodafone.",1
Horrible customer service,"Imagine what is the standard of customer service at Vodafone? I had a written chat with three customer service specialists ([name removed], [name removed] and [name removed]) Every time these individuals were about to cancel my mobile phone services with Vodafone, my internet got disconnected with each one of them ( I repeat, yes that's right, with each one of them, sounds like a Hollywood movie climax, isn't it?) I had to go through the identification process and then answer why do you want to leave us and wait for them to read through the notes? I spent one and a half hours!! They're still unsure of why I want to quit!! Guys at Vodafone, can you trace back who I am on July 15, 2019??? Can you fix this rocket science issue please!!!",1
Customer service surprisingly helpful,"I recently needed to get a new sim and port a number.  I called and found what was obviously a foreign call centre and, having experience with Telstra's foreign call centre I was expecting long delays and poor service, but I was pleasantly surprised.  everything went as I expected, without waiting too long, and when I had difficulty removing the sim I got put through quickly to a tech guy who walked me through it.  I'm still a little stunned that I didn't get a bad experience because frankly 'bad' seems to be the corporate standard these days.  So yeah, nice one Vodaphone.",4
Customer service surprisingly helpful,just to clarify the details on my plan this is a 365 day plan emergency phone for an elderly relative to use in case the electricity goes out and takes the phone with it in what could be an emergency situation.  NBN has changed our phone network to 3rd world standards.  and don't get me started on that......,4
Pathetic,"Bought into a new mobile phone contract and really wished I hadn't bothered.  Apple phone that is plainly defective and while we should all make allowances for the odd factory defect it has been the terrible service recovery behind this.  I have two options for my brand new phone that has yet to make it to the first phone call.  1.  Head to my nearest vodafone shop and try and get this fixed, or, wait 72 hours for their technicians to assess and determine the servicability of this phone or system.  However you look at this the service level is below par.  Enter into a contract at your own risk.  I wish to god I never took the advice of probably one of the few customers who have not experienced their incompetence.  The ombudsman will be contacted and I feel a friendly warning is invited for anyone contemplating entering into a contract with this mob of incompetents.  Ps - never received an email even advised the phone number or any other critical setup info.",1
Missing credit,"Two months ago l traded my Samsung S7 in for a new Samsung S10 but the incompetent sales member did not process the credit and also sent my old phone to some obscure store. I was entitled to a $305 credit which l have been chasing ever since, to no avail. I have rung the call centre ( in India ) on a few occasions without success and l have been back in store three times and spoken with three different people, including the manager. On each occasion they have assured me that they will escalate the claim and make sure it is sorted. They have also told me that they would ring me but that has never happened. Each time l exit the store they must think great, we will put that aside and continue doing nothing. I find the service incompetent and shallow. After being with Vodafone for over 15 years it is time to move on. In addition, l find the reception is poor and getting worse. I experience constant dropouts, painful interference and poor reception. Even after consulting Samsung directly who instructed me to reset the phone connection status, it is still unreliable. I  now regret my decision to trade in my old Samsung S7.",1
Bad services and ill informed sales people,"Very weak reception and when asked they say towers are being built, been really long to be true. They advice me to use VOIP, whatâ€™s the point of paying them",1
Rating purely on Vodafoneâ€™s Twitter Customer Service,"Received excellent customer service from their Twitter account, my issue was dealt with immediately and was resolved the same day. Left me having a positive view of Vodafone Australia! Keep up the good work on Social Media Vodafone :)",5
Will never sign up again. Indian customer service is a total joke,"After 2 months of chasing the incompetent Vodafone team in India, I have STILL not received a credit from trading in my phone and continues to be added to my bills in addition being charged late fees on a credit on my own trade in phone! I have rung up multiple times and  after multiple assurances and documentation to show I am to receive a credit nothing has happened after much ""sweet"" talking by the Indian customer team. I will be taking this up with the ombudsman and I will en-devour to tell EVERYONE how terrible Vodafone service is.",1
No signal and charged Porting Fee??!,"Been with Vodafone 5 years.  To me city & parramatta signals are not bad but once we go past Newcastle, impossible to get reception. I just ported and  charged $8.  Iâ€™ve ported my number at least 7 times and ONLY VODAFONE charged this â€˜porting feeâ€™",2
The worst provider that you can go with period...,"If I could give 0 stars I definitely would, but for now let me save you from a world of pain before you even think of making that terrible decision of switching to Vodafone. For starters you will get very patchy phone reception and internet close to the CBD and when you do you will consistently lose it making your blood pressure go through the roof, rebooting your phone 10 times a day will then be a necessity. Forget about reception in the saburbs and when you go to country towns, just leave your phone behind, it will not be any use to you.",1
horrible reception to the point of almost unusable,"Not realisable net work at all, data and phone calls are alike, there are many black spots such as Burwood Sydney which is a metropolitan area yet the reception is so bad in some pockets whether a phone call is possible is almost like a gamble",1
"Out of 3 Aussie phone companies, by far the worst service","I've used Telstra, Optus, and Vodafone. I thought Telstra was bad, but Vodafone is much worse. I've actually dealt with customer service issues in 2nd or 3rd world countries that were easier. I ordered a SIM card online and it was never delivered. When I called, it seems it was awaiting stock (how does a telcom company run out of sim cards?) but there was no expected re-stocking/delivery date in sight, so I asked to cancel and refund. refund yet. Their customer service is separated into many individual working parts, and having to re-explain yourself multiple times to representatives that were at times fairly rude, was pretty disappointing from a national company.",1
Unfair charges,"When I went on holidays to Italy and Chile I bought a Travel SIM card from Sim corner, before getting to Italy I removed my a Vodafone SIM card and inserted the Travel one, Which I used while in Italy, to my surprise when I got the bill from Vodafone I was charged $5 for 9 days, when I placed a complaint their excuse was that probably I had a dual card in my phone, which it is not possible, they didnâ€™t believe me that I only had the Travel card from Sim corner, even staff from Sim corner send them a message stating that I used their SIM card, not the Vodafone card.Has anyone else had the same experience?",1
Worst customer service,Customer service reps have no idea what they are doing.Asking same questions and not even referring the notes.No help or support at all.,1
Worst service,"phone has only emergency call only until when I restarted, now I could call but there is no network for internet, when tried to call vodafone to resolve the issues, numbers are not contactable. Vodafone network has never been reliable but never been this bad until recently. Although they are the cheapest, guess you get what you paid for. Do not sign up for vodafone. I hd enough and jumping to optus now !! Such a bad service",1
Vodaphone - don't ever contact me again after wasting hours and hours of my time with no result,"Vodaphone did a systems upgrade, end result I can't log into my own account. 3.5 hours of my time wasted, lied to about lodging a Telecommunications Ombudsman complaint on my behalf, want to charge me for transcripts of my own conversations with them going over the same actions over and over and over with no results, at the rate of $35 per hour of transcript so a minimum cost of $140 to get the print outs to put with my TO complaint.  Their Privacy Office - which deals with this type of complaints - did everything they could to discourage me from loding the TO complaint.  After hours of stress and wasted time, end result, 14 new pin numbers, continually deleting and redownloading the app - final advice was to go to a Vodafone shop in person .  Even to lodge a request for the transcripts, go and print the form out, sign it and then scan it back.  Obviously designed to discourage people from lodging complaints if they don't have access to printers and scanners.  No, they don't compensate you the hours of your time wasted trying to get them to fix the problem.  One customer service guy smugly told me I should be congratulating him on fixing the problem - but the problem wasn't fixed at all.  Never ever would I recommend Vodafone to others, and I won't be continuing my service with them either.  Disgraceful.",1
Billing cycles and final invoice,"I have been a customer for 18 years, yes, 18 years! Obviously I have been happy with the service, generally. Any expectation of coverage outside the major cities is a wish list, but Iâ€™m a user in the large mainland cities. The overseas usage is fantastic when roaming with other providers ... AUD5 extra on local plan for 24 hours is very worthwhile.I have 3 mobile services with Vodafone. Today I finally closed 1 number.My problem is the cost and time of closing down a number. There appears to be a deliberate set of barriers to make this extremely difficult. This cannot be done in stores, and I tried many. Itâ€™s a time waster trying to do it on the phone, and the chat line consists of being offered unwanted benefits. What should be a 10 minute job, took nearly 45 minutes. 
And the worst, and unconscionable, part is the withholding of paid in advance fees. A fee for NO, NIL, ZILCH service. 
This wasnâ€™t a material amount, about AUD38 ... but the ethic of it suggests a company not socially responsible but driven by profit in any way. Not something to be proud of Vodafone, but I believe youâ€™ll hide behind the veil of corporate contracts.",4
Shifty company,"I just recharged my prepaid internet. Vodafail's website stated that for $60 I'd get 25 GB and 90 days' expiry date. On recharging, however, I now find out I only get 60 days to use these 25 GB and that the 90-day expiry period was only for the bonus SMS. This was NOT STATED on the initial recharge page!!! I tried to find a way to contact Voda for assistance with this or at least to provide feedback and their website was hopeless, leading me around in circles. So here I am. I decided to come here. Thanks Vodafail. That's what happens when you don't allow people to email or chat with you to get support. They leave bad reviews which other people read.

This is without a doubt one of the top 3 companies I would label as most shifty (the other 2 being outright scammers who quickly went out of business). The way they run their website is misleading and immoral in the extreme. If they lived in ancient times, they would have been stoned to death many times over.

Oh, and by the way, I don't appreciate how you don't allow me to recharge my internet when it goes below 500 MB. You tell me I have under 700 MB left and then I'm told I can't access the internet? How does that work? You just disregard those few hundred MBs? How am I supposed to recharge when I can't access your site? It should be free to access, as it used to! I should not have to go to a neighbour's house to use their internet to recharge my plan! And there should be no expiry date on recharge credit, as there used to be. That's why it's called PREPAID! If I wanted a monthly plan, I'd go with another company providing better service.

Frankly, I don't know why I bother, as so many times your internet has dropped out for days at a time with no explanation whatsoever. I think you guys are on your last legs. You've stolen enough of my hard-earned money, and I hope with all my heart you don't get to enjoy one single red cent of it. Signed, One of Many You've Screwed Over. (Some of us can't get NBN, you nitwits).",1
No network and vodafone contact numbers are not contactable,"8/6/2019 15:30pm, phone has only emergency call only until when I restarted, now I could call but there is no network for internet, when tried to call vodafone to resolve the issues, numbers are not contactable.

Terrible experience.,"If you are an Australian looking to buy a SIM card whilst in Italy, don't go there.  They told me completely incorrect information (if not Word Removed) about which card to purchase, and sold me a near useless SIM card (@ E25.00) for what I needed (ability to contact Australian numbers, and use in Malta as well as Italy).  The initial fee deducted, and 2 x SMSs used up  the entire mobile call and Text allowance, and it could not be used in Malta for anything.  Nor could I monitor any usage because they signed me up to the Vodafone NZ (yes New Zealand) app. I can only conclude that as a low value customer they just wished to get me out of their shop ASAP. The locals suggested I should have used the TIM network.",1
Unbelievably Rude,"I can add a new experience from my lunch break today. I toddled off to Vodafone as my contract is just running out again ! I walked to the nearest store. I had a Vodafone rep. helping me, we were looking at a couple of plans on the screen sitting on the counter, then along came another consultant whipped the keyboard off him and she then started helping her customer. The guy who was helping me said nothing, but for me it was complete disbelief as I had to wait for her to finish with her new customer to finish before I could resume. Question is now should I stay with Vodafone? They have already had a 2nd chance??",1
Worst Network,Signal constantly changes from 3g to 4g and i never have more than 2 bars even in town. Occasionally drops into regional service which has no data and it is impossible to reconnect. Terrible speeds. Avoid this network,1
Terrible customer service. Rude phone staff. Takes forever to get issues resolved.,Drops out constantly. Only live 10 minutes from the center of town. impossible to have a conversation with someone.Speed was okay but not worth the trouble.Would not recommend to anyone.,1
Book and appointment with a psychiatrist before calling their customer service,Customer service keeps forwarding you to another department where you have to identify yourself and introduce your problem again. This can happen uptown 5 times on a single call.Customer service will very professionally educate you about the various departments and their responsibilities when they tell you it's someone else's problem.Get ready for a roller coaster ride of frustration,1
False Promises by Vodafone,"They promise better network, upgrades in network towers but from last seven years they are unable to provide better network in Western Suburbs (Tarneit/Truganina), City and Docklands. Vodafone fails in satisfying customers with Network issues and customer service. Vodafone has confirmed the network issues and upgrades happening in these areas, and they donâ€™t have ETA. They only apologies and keep charging your monthly payments or resolves all the issues by providing small amount of credits back to the customer but not fulfilling the promises they have made, which doesnâ€™t help in getting better service. Almost 95% of my calls made or received I have to repeat myself or call fails. Customerâ€™s dissatisfaction is grown but no action taken. People who are facing issues with Vodafone please need to raise voice for a better service.",1
Very behind the other 2 mobile carriers,"Horrible service when calling those clowns overseas, they keep telling me to call the George St store in the City to organize an appointment to have my phone replaced, but they dont have contact details for stores, nor do they have that number anywhere to be found, so I need to risk going all the way to the city to be told we dont have the phone in stock. Reception absolutely sucks and it isn't even cheaper like it used to be.Just lacking common sense. Optus and Telstra are rolling out 5g, and Vodafone is still trying to get 3g to work in some places",1
Bad service and very bad internet.,"I joined Vodafone after 3 days of very bad internet I and reception rang customer services got the runaround, 30 day satisfaction guarantee they refund your money rubbish! they  kept my money then sent a bill for $8 dollars for porting my number to another provider when I left after 1 week. Used a boost even with full reception still very slow to no internet",1
Super disappointed services,"I joined Vodafone as prepaid subscriber since Nov 2018, yet on late Jan this year I've been offered a postpaid package. I took the 12-months plan with high expectation that the level of services will be better or at least maintained. Unfortunately, what I got is a lower quality services.s totally unreachable. 

I have complained 3 times for this issue, Vodafone customer service always came with same promises that it is escalated to technical team & will be resolved soon. The reality is until today, it's still not resolved & they never come back to me with any update nor resolution. I don't understand how super difficult it is to resolve this account creation issue in MyVodafone. I'm super disappointed with this & would not recommend Vodafone any longer.",1
Not happy,I've been with Vodafone for a long period of time and have had four plans with them.  Vodafone customer care had removed my plans  discounts after having a long discussion that's when they were convinced to give the discount back. Also they do not keep their promises what they said also I had a NBN100 premium connection but I didn't get  more than 20 Mbps.,1
Excellent service Vodafone Brookside Qld,Moved my mobile service over to Vodafone today after being with another supplier for 15 years. Jackie was professional and gave clear information. Highly recommend her and this Vodafone outlet,5
Very very poor network,Even data wont work properly. I have been so annoyed with it. Data is too much slow. Very very poor network. You guys should improve otherwise no one gonna use Vodafone in future.,1
plans over still charging $80 for 12 gig,look service is fine data is slow during the day in the city same with most networks after work hours its fast againwhat got me is i have been with them for 5 years bills all ways paid etc contracts over and plan doesn't get cheaper still charging $80 for 12 gigs i call and they said they Do not change your plan but now that i have called they can offer a cheaper plan no thank you i am going to another company.how many people are over paying for a service that others charge for a third the price ?,2
I've always been really happy.,"I honestly can't fault Vodafone. Yeah patchy service sometimes but that's pretty normal (whoever you're with), but everything else just rolls really smoothly. Credit card fees feel a bit archaic but I'm making an effort to actually share positive views of companies, rather than just complaining. There's not really much to hate about them. Really like how much time they give you to prepare for direct debits, too.",4
Vodafone is the best telco company for quality and customer service!,Vodafone has been nothing short of brilliant with our phones so we changed our internet which was terrible with Telstra and the support we got from Telstra was an absolute joke alone with the service. Vodafone have went above and beyond in store and on the phone and we are stoked with our phones and nbn!,5
Very bad coverage &amp; frustrating customer support - they expect me to wait 1 to 3 months to get better coverage!!!,"Very bad coverage in my area (metro area in Sydney), frequent call drop outs, and broken voice calls, very slow data download and sometimes no download at all.I rang customer service 6 times in 2 days they offer no real solutions, they keep assuring everything will be fine but nothing happens. When they felt that I am not accepting their unkept promises and unlogic solutions, they transferred my call to ""Resolve"" team, that team advised me that if I can't wait for 1 to 3 months for the service to get better, I can shift to other provider and vodafone will give me 50% discount on the fees for this month!!!I am porting my line to a better & more professional provider.",1
Vodafone is not customer friendly when itâ€™s not their way.,"I have been a loyal customer of Vodafone for over 20 years. Last year I upgraded my plan which included the iPhone 8 Plus, the phone was massively talked up by the sales staff and it was exactly what I wanted because of the features as I have the iPhone 5S. I was so excited to get the phone, however within 2weeks of me owning the phone I noticed it started to play up. I did what I had too to the phone (re-booting it to original settings etc) , the problems got worse so I started to complain to Vodafone. The first time I complained they said I was two days late with returning the phone to receive a brand new one, I also found out that they didnâ€™t put insurance. I questioned Vodafone as to why they werenâ€™t forthcoming with their return policy, they had nothing to say except, sorry. Since than the phone got worse, Iâ€™ve made numerous calls to Vodafone and Apple and I did exactly what both companies told me to do. Fast forward to now, I was told by a Vodafone shop to record the evidence of what the phone is doing so I canâ€™t be denied, which I did as said Vodafone isnâ€™t nice without evidence. I was told by Vodafone to get the phone assessed by Apple which I did, Apple saw the problems and evidence I have, Apple is on my side. Now Vodafone is saying I should never of gone to Apple and it has to be sent away for Vodafone to assess it, reluctantly I sent it away. Vodafone has the evidence of the phone and are telling me the phone is PERFECT and I have to put up with the phone or take it to Apple to get a replacement which I declined because Iâ€™m not paying nearly $1,500 for a replacement that Vodafone or Apple canâ€™t guarantee itâ€™s not 2nd hand plus I can get a replacement phone for a fraction of the cost like I did my daughters iPhone 6. Vodafoneâ€™s attitude when it comes to being honest and doing the right thing by the customer is abhorrent. They speak down to you like your crap and â€˜I have your money now put up with the crap we gave youâ€™. Even the Vodafone store said â€˜thatâ€™s normal for the phone to do thatâ€™ I told them â€˜why doesnâ€™t my iPhone 5S do itâ€™ the woman shut her mouth, she also said that she has had plenty of customers who have complained about the phone.
TIO from Vodafone said they have to assess the phone twice before they do anything, really, Vodafone assessers are a massive conflict of interest especially when the phone is assessed without the customer there to keep them honest. The Apple store does the right thing by assessing the phone with the customer there. 
Iâ€™m currently going through the Telecommunications Ombudsman. 
My resolution to Vodafone is a brand new phone that is NOT faulty (like it should of been from the start/ what I pay for) or a refund of the money that has been spent plus the insurance money, they totally reject it. Insurance with Vodafone is a waste! 
Vodafone is a scam and are only nice when it goes their way. 1 star rating is too good for them.

May 21st 2019 Update: Deserves no stars

Vodafone is an abhorrent company. They only think of money and thatâ€™s it. They with hold information that benefits them, gives out faulty phones and donâ€™t provide what their supposed to. Stay clear from Vodafone, they have gone down hill fast, rude, arrogant and the above. Iâ€™ll be changing company after being with them for 20yrs.",1
Am I the only person to have noticed that Vodafone has effectively doubled the cost of 365 day pre-paid data ?,"I recently attempted to top-up my pre-paid account, only to discover that the 365 Plus product is no longer available. Its nearest equivalent is the Pay and Go product, which at $40 offers the same 365 day expiry, the same pricing for texts and calls ... but doubles the price of data (previously $0.02/Mb, now  $0.04/Mb). I've queried this with Vodafone and they basically just blew smoke at me.",1
Very poor signal despite their claims,I have been with Vodafone for nearly a year and its most painful year for me interms of phone reception!! I have to keep up with it since I am in contract as there is hardly any signals. I dont live in remote region either .,1
Absolutely shocking service over the phone and in store.,My PUK number kept disabling on its own so I was unable to transfer money while in the shop.Very hard to hear/understand over the phone support.Could not receive calls from Vodafone users.,1
"Wonderful service, great pricing!","Service was incredible as always, Jerome made the entire process incredibly clear and easy. Weâ€™ve shopped around looking at plans for a while now, but none have been better than the ones offered at Vodafone, and for a fraction of the price too. Will definitely be staying with vodafone in the future.",5
Changing Providers,"Vodafone is a joke. I was simply trying to top up the data on my phone... accessed the Vodafone recharge page - insufficient data. Kind of hard to recharge when I cant access the page. And considering I have wireless internet at home and I also tried completing recharge while connected to that, still told me I had insufficient data.I'll be changing phone carriers due to this experience. Network coverage is pretty low. The online website is glitchy and full of freezes and hard to navigate when it constantly freezes and reloads.",1
Less of the product for the same price.,"Blocked BitChute, 8chan, and other websites at a mere government ""suggestion"".Blocking internet platforms from the public such as BitChute should be considered a crime against the public. Blocking free communication is like modern book burning.",1
Poor signal can't register,Poor signalPayments not going throughTryed registering 4 times no luckTryed temporary passwords over and over as didn't like my original passwordSeems its designed to stress you out so gave up never againSo next month im changing network,1
Soo out of touch with small businesses !,"I got into a contract and bought a phone as well. I was starting up a business. As any retail business there are 1000 things to do when you start-up. I received their Invoice , then when the direct debit was unsuccessful ( normal at the fitout stage) I started to be harressed by phone calls and messages every single day, from Day 1 after the direct debit failed! I called Vodafone and asked to pay in cash. They advised to go to one of theirs branches. I went to one of their branches (30 km away) and I was told they were not accepting cash and I had to pay by card ( pointless) or go to Australia Post and pay extra fees, then scan the receipt and send it to Vodafone !?? Are you guys for real??? Do you even understand how a small business operates and how much spare time do business owners have???  Unbelievable!!",2
Censorship is huge,"Since the incident in NZ, Vodafone has begun censoring websites from access for no reason at all. What good is a service provider if I can't access the services I wish to access?",1
Terrible,"Terrible customer service, terrible provider services. Terrible after sales service - I am disappointed- spoiled my day. They do not care once you are in the contract. Will never suggest it to anyone",1
Slow 4G speeds in many locations.,"Poor 4G speeds in various locations in the Sydney CBD. Contacted the customer support a few times with no results. Anyhow, time to look for a service provider which has a good 4G coverage.",1
8 months of constant bad call quality and data problems,"I signed up to Vodafone after years with Telstra. I had problems from Day 1 - mainly with call quality and people on the other side not being able to hear me properly. Despite two handset changes, and now a 3rd on the way, Vodafone customer service has treated me with absolute contempt, openly flaunting Australian Consumer Law and telling me I would have to take it up with the ombudsman. The call centre individuals arrogance was palpable - telling me I couldnâ€™t take it higher than him and was extremely rude to me",1
This company should be closed down until they supply the coverage they say the can supply!!!!,It always drops out I have spoken to your tech support and been given every excuse to explain poor coverage I have been loyal to Vodafone and 3 but not for much longer !!!,1
Vodafone not to be Trusted,Charged me  $112.95. For leaving there service .sent me a Collection Agency Warning. .if I don't pay up. ..Be careful with the con sign up. Ask if you join another service. .what is the best option out. ....,1
too muc$ for not much,Prepay Vodafail represents poor value:Vodafone has always been lagging behind the competition. They should spend less on promotion and more on delivering.- poor network coverage - one of the problems of privatisation of an essential service is network duplication in high population areas with no signal elsewhere- high prices for what is a distant 3rd patchy network- less data than their competition for the pricecannot switch off unwanted promo messages despite requests to Vodafone and complaints to useless regulatory bodyPrices should be at least 20-30% less than their competition to equate value,1
Internet,"Their ""4G"" internet speed is slower than the first ever dial-up connection. Sydney CBD speeds are below 10mb/s download and under 5mb/s upload. Please don't go vodafone as you will regret it.",1
Just alright,"I have been on a prepaid service with Vodafone for about 2 years. All I can say is that it hasn't been excellent but also not awful - myVodafone is not very reliable as I've experienced numerous times where it's dropped out, but they give a bunch of ways for you to top up. The data bundles could be better - overall there are cheaper companies which I think I will be transferring to in a few months.",3
Sensational customer service,"We received outstanding service and assistance at Rosebud Vodafone.The person who served us was an absolute legend - extremely knowledgeable, efficient and so pleasant to deal with. 10/10. We hope he never leaves this store.",5
Are there any fewer stars than 1?,"""Customer service"" is an interesting concept. One which Vodafone seem not to have grasped. Staff at Forest Hill gave false and contradictory information. I was in the store to ask to have my phone unlocked. Not sure why it was locked. A salesperson in store asked me to call Vodafone and the recorded message instructed me to get online - while I was standing in store.  Far better customer service at Optus who now have my business.",1
Class Action Lawsuit Anyone?,"I am ready to sue Vodafone over there poor customer service, I need a minimum of 7 people who are interested in joining a class action lawsuit against them. X... it kept freezing when I was texting or using my apps. So I walked into a Vodafone Outlet off Lonsdale Street in Melbourne CBD and was advised by the store person I needed to take my phone to Apple for an assessment of hardware. 
So I did exactly that, to only be advised that there were no hardware issues.
I reported back to Vodafone via phone and they advised I would need to take my phone into another store and hand it in so they can send it off to be reviewed. At this point, 3 weeks of having a brand new handset I refused to do so and that I was going to open a TIO case against them. Which I did (still ongoing, 4 months later)...

",1
Absolutely stupid,"Customer service is telling me four thousand different things for the problem, at first the issue at hand is recoverable and can be turned around. A second later I've been connected to a different department, telling me that I can't fix the issue relating to mobile number porting. Completely lack of awareness and care. The effort was put in to try to understand, but nothing prevailed in the end. Massive waste of time trying to call them for an hour to fix things, no wonder I switched telco company mid way.",1
retarded company,"after a halfwit broke into my car and was able to order several phones in my name and paid by SOMEONE ELSES's credit card. I have provided all police reports and info to them to find out a year later that they have sold my debt to a debt company. Now I have to run around to prove that me its me, however they did not ask the guy who stole my stuff to run around to prove it was me.",1
Buying a phone and credit check - Stay away from vodafone!!!,"While everyone will have a different story about the topic I will share mine.ks as otherwise I would have ordered both together.

The phone ordered was meant for my wife as a present and I mentioned the same to the agent and requested to process it asap as the website mentioned 1-2 days delivery once approved. I was told 24 hours max to process the order, but didn't hear anything from them and decided to contact to check status. I was told the credit application was rejected. I couldn't believe this as I am on a permanent job, well paid, own a house (on mortgage though like 90% of people out there), has very good credit history and never had any defaults. I asked Vodafone why this the case. I was told its the third party credit checking organisation's decision and suggested to contact them. Fair enough, I contacted them to check why my application was rejected, only to be told that my credit history is good and can't see any issues and suggested me to check with Vodafone as it is them who rejected my application. Called Vodafone again and asked why they rejected the application. To my surprise they said there were no issues with the credit check, but Vodafone decided not to provide me the phone for reasons they cannot disclose or further explain. What?? Honestly? I spent my time going to your stores, doing research, speaking to your customer service, put forward an application to buy, even did credit check,which I passed, only to to be told that my application is rejected by Vodafone for no reason?? Even after this the customer service agent asked me to try buying again online as this time it might go through successfully. Seriously?? 

You guys lost a customer for life and let this word be out there for people who care about their credit history. Do not trust vodafone with credit checks.",1
Don't use Vodafone its bad,"Vodaphone is really bad if you use the Internet a lot. Vodafone for me dropouts a least more then 1 every 30 mind this can get annoying because maybe in a in the middle of an call the Internet drops out and our chat gets interrupted. Also it takes so long for the Internet to connect back too. Other thing is its the speed Is fast then a second later super slow, I hate this when I playing video games. This is my experience with Vodafone maybe your Vodafone is good.",1
Exit Fees,"They could not meet up better deal so changed to another company, asked them if there was any exit fees and they said no, but sent a bill with the exit fees. Hopeless service.",1
Excellent customer services,"On my last bill I got charged almost 10 times then what I usually pay. I when to Vodafone store at Loganholme. We talked to one of the staff, her name Jenny. Sheâ€™s really helpful and she acknowledged me on what happened on the bill. I had a really impressive experience with her.",5
Customer service,"I went to 2 vodafone outlets, Carindale close to Best and Less and the one in the city Queenstreet Mall close to Typo, i ask if i can change my last name on my account they said they need a new ID with my new name on it as the marriage certificate that I have that time was apparently "" just a piece of paper"" . So got my drivers licence changed. Came back again(Carindale outlet) and said they need the marriage certificate to change my name. How inconsistent they are. Do your company a favour, train your people well!!! not signing up with you again.",1
Helpline is a JOKE...,"Firstly, how about employing helpline operators whose first language is english.",1
Horrible Customer Service - Not sure how they are still doing business,"After being a customer for 15 years, very happy that I took my business elsewhere. Bad service, drop outs with very slow internet connection. Customer service is extremely poor, their supervisors in their call Centre is even worse. Shame on Vodafone. Their shareholders should sack the executive team!!",1
misleading informations,"Im  just very unhappy with Vodafone customer service. I will not buy anything from them when my recent plans finished and will not recommend it to anyone else (as I did to many by now)They mislead me to a service they did not have ( they told me I can receive sms in Iran - I went near 10 month to Iran and I was not able to activate roaming and receive sms)I wanted a refund for these 10 months but they did not even care!so disappointed, I paid for something I was not being able to useSo unhappy",1
"Been with Vodafone for 5 years, never had an issue...â€¦.until now!!","It appeatrrs that I had a service added to my account last year, which the sales guy told me ""wouldn't cost me anything, so would be good to have so a family member can share your allowances"", however it turns out it has cost me over $1K in the last 10 months, best part is I've never used it!!! Now they are telling me that I have to list it as fraud and go through the process of getting my money back, even though they have a recording of the phone conversation between myself and the sales guy from Vodafone...â€¦..",1
Ridiculously bad 4g speed 0.5Mb/s,"I changed from virgin mobile last year because of price hikes, the 4G download speeds with them were always between 14mb/s and 25mb/s. Now i am on Vodafone my download speeds are consistently lower than 0.8mb/s. Its barely enough to run a youtube video.",1
Itâ€™s terrible,Locking me out of my own account for an hour just because i forgot my password?? and even though i get into it because iâ€™m using cellar data i canâ€™t use anything?? this is the worst service ever in history. Hope you guys go bankrupt soon. disgraceful,1
No initiative- unless that can take your money,"I have been having issues with poor signal for a while, and I have been contacting Vodafone regularly regarding this.Only once I contacted them to cancel my contract so I can move to a service that actually gives me the service I pay for, they informed me that it is because my SIM card has not been updated since 2015 (6 years ago). And they tried to say it was my fault because I have been using my old SIM card- which is untrue.When I upgraded my iPhone they gave me a new SIM as my old one couldnâ€™t be broken down to use for my new phone. So after taking time off work to get the new SIM card, it still didnâ€™t fix the issue.",1
Network coverage seems to get worse,The network was not bad before- used to get few bars around home. But some recent upgrades before a month or so has led to having no network coverage when inside the house or even backyard. It is same for rest of family and neighbours too.,1
Thieves,"I was with Vodafone for more than ten years and I was robbed all this time, they steal your data, they can not be trusted, I noticed when I changed to another provider my data lasted much longer.",1
Finally moving on after 17 years..no longer competitive,"We have been with Vodafone almost from the start, so coming up to 20 years (having been with Orange before that, remember them?) and in the main no issues to really worry about. Yes the speed was sometimes slow, yes there were occasional billing Issues and yes customer service was a little flat and impersonal but overall we were satisfied enough. Their mobile plans, unfortunately, though one of the cheapest around were not competitive when compared to prepaid, however, they always in the past tried to work something out to convince me to stay. Yesterday i only rang to discuss a phone upgrade for me and to leave my husbands plan as is. WELL, the sales pitch began...i currently use 5gb/mth and my husband uses less than 1gb and we share 15gb between the two phones very comfortably. The only plan they could offer was 100gb shared! And of course the price goes up almost double what i am currently paying, not including the phone!!! The guy got quite rude when i wouldn't commit straight away and ended the call very abruptly. My kids, who have been convincing me to go across to Kogan for a year now, showed me their prepaid plans and there is no comparison. I can see some customers complain about Kogan speeds and customer service, but my kids watch movies and stream all the time and they say there is hardly any issue at all... they say telco â€˜plansâ€™ are such an antiquated notion, no one under 30 is on anything but prepaid, and I can see why.  I even bought the phone i wanted from Kogan through Afterpay (otherwise i would be held to ransom with Vodafone for the next 3 years on a plan). I just dont think its good enough anymore for a company to be so inflexible in 2021. Like with everything else, big Telcos and companies dont care about customer loyalty and as a customer i am finally cutting the umbilical cord with a lot of these guys. We left Optus after 20 years and couldn't be happier with Aussie Broadband, and now this... Goodbye Vodafone!",3
Wonderful experience with call service,"Being a Saturday, I was hesitant about calling and having to wait so long to speak to someone. To my surprise I was served by such a knowledgeable person who fixed my NBN connection quickly and sufficiently. Really appreciate this!",5
POOR SERVICE,Poor coverage across metro Sydney. Two service breakdowns in same month. 3 days with no data and still no fix! Unacceptable. Waiting for my new Optus sim in mail so I can get what I paid for. Poor form Vodafone Australia.,1
Call centre staff wonderful,I have been with vodafone for well over a decade. The call centre staff have always been wonderful to me when I have a query. I just want to say thank you to them. I am loyal to vodafone because of you.,5
Constant outages and bad customer service,"There are constant outages and even when there is a national outage, they take for a long time to fix it, and do not award their customers for their fault and mistakes.",1
"Poor service, don't stick to their own policies","I bought s21 ultra 2 phones on a plan early Feb 2021Right from the start one of the phones data would not  work at all and I went to Vodafone store. They told me their policy  was to replace any defective phone if told within 28 days. I told them soon much bfo 28 days including going physically to greensborough store 2 times and preston store 2 times and craigieburn once...noone offered replacement although it was their policy to do a swap....They couldn't fix the issue...told I had to call tech support...I did and they couldn't do anything but still not offered a swap

They told me to drop it to Vodafone n they  will fix in 7- 10 days
I gave it on April 1st 2021 and today 19 days later they haven't returned it nor fixed it and they can't even give me update. In meantime I'm using a low grade phone for last 2 months while waiting for Vodafone to get their act together

Absurd n ridiculous n frustration but they don't care",1
No coverage in Miranda NSW for about 1 month,We have 4x SIM mobile plans with VodafoneNo coverage in Port Hacking Rd in Miranda NSW for about 1 month in December 2020Again - some works for 2 weeks in April 2021 and no Cellular Coverage!Our business depends on the Network - so we were affected for a long timeWhen we asked for compensation - we got offered $35...,1
Terrible mobile data,Had been with Telstra for a year and had had no problems switched to Vodafone and have had so many problems. The first problem was trying to transfer my number it didn't work. This was kind of the other providers problem but still. The coverage has been terrible compared to Telstra I'm in the middle of a town and there 1 bar. There was also a network outage for a few days. Not very happy with them will be switching back to Telstra.,2
They tricked me,I got the worse experience. I used mobile broad bond and I went to marketplace leichhardt nsw shop band I asked them about the modem if I will pay for it. They confirmed I will not and I could cancel any time.I explained to them I needed only for few months and they confirmed it will be no extra charge. When I wanted to cancel their service they asked me for $200 for the modem.,1
The Best Aussie Provider By Far,"I really don't understand all the negative reviews. I switched to Vodafone quite desperately after going through a nightmare with iiNet where we had to wait 9 months to get nbn installed at our address while PAYING AS IF WE HAD NBN, and got fobbed off constantly. I got sick of it and ended my contract with them early, not before being slapped with a $200 fee for cancelling early, and switched all of our mobile and internet services to Vodafone. Lo and behold, what took iiNet 9 months to pretend to complete, Vodafone got done in less than 7 days after switching to them! Since they installed nbn, our internet has been flawlessly reliable and extremely fast. The new 5G mobile network is the same, and on the rare occasion we have needed support their staff are extremely friendly, helpful and fast. I have absolutely no complaints so far. Easily the best experience I have ever had with a provider. I will certainly be a customer for many years to come!",5
Horrible experience,"Customer service was horrible!I have been offered a discount for 5 numbers transfer to Vodafone. Once the numbers were transferred to Vodafone, the customer service told me the offer was not right amount, ask to pay way more than what suppose to be.They are not trustworthy.",1

Misinformation,Have been with Vodafone for over 20 years but phone was in my husbands name (my phone though).   Was told if I swapped into my name that i could keep my loyalty. NO. thatâ€™s not true   went ahead anyway.   Go to up grade my phone but canâ€™t do because my credit rating isnâ€™t good enough.   Account has NEVER been paid late.  Payment will still be coming out if the same account.  Have been in the same job for over 18 years and my credit ratings bad.   First of all youâ€™re given the wrong info and secondly only half the info.  Looks like youâ€™ve lost a customer.  Not that you would careAlso the person we dealt with was so rude and his English was appallingSo so disappointed,1
Vodafone international roaming RUBBISH!!,"I used VODAFONE prepaid sim switched to roaming on my trip to Amsterdam, Paris, London via Hong Kong & return via ShanghaiTerrible !! Does NOT work properly - EVER !! Absolutely rubbish product.My prepaid Vodafone SIM on iPhone SE works perfectly IN AUSTRALIA",1
No loyalty with Vodafone,"After 16 years being with Vodafone i must say worst experience Ive had. Called up to complain about the service as Ive taking camping and traveling further out gave me no coverage. i also had issues with the service at work and had to step outside every time to get coverage which got really annoying. The customer service rep advised me that i was on a older product from 2016 and that i needed to change to 2019 product and would save money and ignored the fact i was complaining about the coverage. After 30mins on the call i had enough as i got so frustrated and advised to cancel my plan which finishes up in April 2019 over 24months. Based on the remaining 5 months i was charged approx 350 to cancel when a service couldn't be provided. After being a loyal customer for 16 years i must say worst experience and service, least they could have done was waive the cancellation fee as i still had my wife's plan and my tablets with vodafone but they where happy to lose the entire business and customer. No longer a Advocate of vodafone",1
Stay well away from vodafone,"I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a new phone or contract with Vodafone. Tip for everyone, look somewhere else. I've been with Vodafone 9 year and the last 2 years has been the worst customer service I have ever had in my life. This is about vodafone customer care 191 and customer service head office complaint, they also don't know how to do a sar requests. 30 days now passed, call Vodafone to be told not action. Need to wait another 30 days poor poor service. Stay well away from Vodafone.",1
Cut off my voicemail,"Vodafone stopped my voicemail. Voicemail stopped working unbeknownst to me! I missed many messages with zero alerts. When i checked my voicemail, i was asked to set it up from scratch. It was already set up and working without issue!!!! What's going on here?  Poor practice resulting in missed calls to me the customer. I will never recommend this company. -1.",1
Terrible experience,Terrible experience and network in Torquay 3228 and while I requested them to change my provider. Vodafone charged me early exit fees and I left vodafone 15 days early and they still charged me full money. Stay away from vodafone Alert !!!!!!!,1
Techncial Support,"Since November 2018 I have been in contact with Vodafone technical support as I am unable to download MMS messages on my Samsung S8 from anyone who sends one from an i  Phone, I initially went to the Vodafone store in Sydney and they were unable to fix the problem and contacted their Tech support team.  This team is absolutely hopeless - they ring me and I explain the problem and then they recommend a change and ask me to get someone to send me an MMS. I do this and they say they will ring back in the next 24 hours often it takes over 3 days to hear from them. I tell them again the problem hasn't been fixed. As it is never the same Tech person who rings I have to go over the problem each time with the new person - (seems like no-one reads any notes they claim they make on any file) They ask the same questions each time which is the Wi Fi off and mobile data on and then they try another fix  with the same result, and again get me to phone some one and get an MMS sent, I have done this countless times - it is very annoying as I have to ask people in their working time to send me an MMS from their i Phone. The tech support people can't do this which would be more useful so I could give them answer as to if the fix worked immediately rather then waiting for them to phone me back which can up up to 3 days.
 
It is now 3 months and I still can't get MMS from people with i Phones. I have put my SIM in other peoples phones and I am able  to receive the MMS. This can't be the first time this problem has occurred.

I have not been getting the full service from my plan which I have been paying for - Vodafone need to fix this and discount my plan fee until fixed.",1
Phone support - poor English,"Made the mistake of extending my contract by phone.   Was a torture test trying to understand what the sales person was saying/offering.  In the end I inadvertently downgraded to a plan that is costing me more.  If you need sales support, make sure you speak to a sales person that speaks reasonable English.",1
Worst worst worst customer service people,"I ordered a router 3 weeks before, they gave a week delivery notice after chasing this for more than 3 weeks they update that the router is missing in shipping and asked us to wait for another couple of week to settle tis. We really frustrated and cancelled the order. Again we went back to store to get the router and paid all the amount and booked the nbn installation and came back again we were waiting for the nbn person to install but not arrived on the given appointment. Again called back to the vodafone service and got the answer like we dont have any details under ur name and no appointment is booked online for the mentioned address. Wow! hats off to all the people who sincerely works for vodafone. Still i was not solved with the issues anyways. PEOPLE PLS BE AWARE OF THIS SUPER DEDICATED EMPLOYEE WHO NEVER CARES FOR THE CUSTOMERS. SHAME ON U ALL.",1
Poor Service,"I am Vodafone customer for last one and half year, got a mobile from them over 2 years time plan with sim for my wife and got my own sim only plan. To my surprise in 8 months it was revealed the sales person had added insurance cost to mobile n sim plan without our knowledge and consent and we were paying this for no reason while we were covered under our content insurance already. So we got it cancelled. After one year my sim only plan was out of fixed contract and free. I keep on getting calls to get into best plan where as I was in my desired best plan already but they perhaps wanted me to get into locking contract again to ensure I do not leave them. After so many calls, my answer was same. But somehow I was passing by their Rundle Mall store and walked into to find what are the options, may be i can upgrade my mobile if its viable. To my surprise I was there for 5-7 minutes, waiting and looking at the staff, most of them busy with their customers, even one or two apparently sitting and able to assist but none of them bothered to acknowledge me and asked why I am there. I am very terrible with such a response from outlests, so did not want to waste my time any more and left.",1
Inefficient knowledge,Customers care donâ€™t have enough knowledge to provide customers about postpaid and prepaid services. Itâ€™s wasting my money and time,1
Nightmare customer service,"Never, ever get any contract with Vodaphone. Their customer service is an absolute nightmare. After many unexpected charges, coming to Â£60 in the first month, whereas I was only paying Â£15 for the same usage with giff gaff, I decided to cancel. Thought this would be easy enough as I was not on a contract. However, it took about 90 minutes online answering stupid questions, and it was only when I threatened to report their customer service online that they finally agreed to give me my pac code, only to then tell me that their system is down so they cant give it to me. This was my third attempt to exit this company. I imagine all Vodaphone's customers are just people who have given up. All I can think of now is to cancel my bank cards. Absolute nightmare. Don't go with this company. And don't even get me started about their overseas rates. They charge Â£6 a day in Australia even if I don't use my phone, and they charge Â£6 per mb even if I'm not using data, but connected to wifi.",1
WARNING DO NOT TRUST THE VODAPHONE COVERAGE GUARANTEE - ITS WORTHLESS!,"WARNING DO NOT TRUST THE VODAPHONE COVERAGE GUARANTEE - ITS WORTHLESS! If you cancel and refuse to pay for non provided service they will ruin your credit rating!My name is Brian Phillis. I moved from Telstra to Vodaphone based on their coverage guarantee. I activated the SIM on my phone but right from the get go, the coverage from vodaphone was not acceptable and I complained to many of the vodaphone customer service people. I informed the Vodaphone people that I would not be activating my wife's SIM and that I wanted to exercise the coverage guarantee but I would persevere with my phone. In the end I had no option but to opt out at a cost and Vodaphone was very good in assisting me. Now they have activated the debt collectors onto my wife's account and will not accept reason that the SIM wasn't activated because the coverage wasn't up to an accepted level. I have tried reasoning with their debt collection people AUSDEBT and with zero empathy or commitment to a positive resolution. In fact, [naem removed] from AUSDEBT responded with this amazing quote: ""When you signed into the contract you would of read the terms and conditions where it states â€˜â€™ Client doesnâ€™t guarantee service to 100% of Australia â€“ On the basis a service wasnâ€™t provided, doesnâ€™t make them exempt from payment. The onus is on the customer to ensure that coverage is available in their area before signing for the service.â€™â€™ Clause 4:11
You took out both services and then decided not to active one of the SIM cards. Dispute is noted but not valid. (sic) Collections will continue"" And the sim card was never activated!
My mission is to inform everyone that I can that they cant trust Vodaphone! The guarantee is only marketing rambling to catch more people!",1
Awful customer service,Iâ€™ve been trying to charge my phone for a week with no sucess itâ€™s ridiculous they get my money from my bank account and take 3/4 days to give it back and I canâ€™t have internet.,1
Great value mobile plan (RedGlobal Sim only),"I use my phone for business and private and love the free calls overseas, no excuses to phone my old relos overseas anymore.  My internet speed through my phone 'internet sharing' is way faster than my Internet service provider  (Belong)  In fact it is so fast Windows 10 decided to once dump my entire hard drive to the cloud through my phone data, luckily I got warned by Vodaphone and so my bill is very consistent.  Never had any bill shock, first time ever in over 15 years.",5
Helpful sales assistance,"The girl who served me was polite without being overly friendly. She explained the plan options very well and I was happy to pay my Samsung Galaxy s9 over 36 months and had flexible payment options. Since my needs were met, I was very satisfied with customer service.",4
Inconsistency in treating customers,"I recently ported vodafone number to new provider where I moved to new provider on the first day of billing cycle, whereas my friend moved to new provider 2 days after billing cycle. We are both on month to month without contract. My friend called vodafone to sort out the bill, they gave 100% waived for the entire month which mean she don't need to pay anything, however, I only received 50% waived and need to pay half the bill $25. This is unacceptable and unjust treatment, they refuse to give me full waived. There is inconsistency in response to customer. I'm not sure there is something I can do for justice.",1
Vodafone Customer Care is Helpless,"We ordered two phones through Vodafone customer care and it went well at the early stage while ordering the product, but for some reason one of our phone havent got delivered, the vodafone couldnt track it and they were delaying it and were not able to give the correct info for the delay, they confirmed with us that they are going to reorder it and we called 4 times to check the status and tracking number but they were no able to give us the info and they were providing different information during each time. the people know about the attitude of the vodafone customer care. They talk nicely and hear everything and they say that they are going to process it but they wont resolve the issue and you wont get any info regarding your concern, so you have to call them again to check the status, then you have to start again and this time also the will say they will process it and nothing happens, the only text you get is the feedback thing..!! They dont care about any complaints the manager himself advised me that he will give the reference number to lodge a complaint to telecommunication ombudsman which was a bit rude. I am helpless now, think twice guys while choosing them, each time when you call the customer care is a pain.",1
Losing 4g always,Vodafone never wake up and upgrade them network still very bad as 8 years ago . They just greedy thinking how to make money with bas service,1
MyVodafone registration online not working- processes are SOOO frustrating! NOT WO,"I have been trying to register for MyVodafone online to activate my Roaming- it returns a blank page, the webpage is not working. Then I tried to call their helpline but cannot remember the pin number I got the day I joined Vodafone. Now I am sitting with no way of activating my roaming which leaves me no choice but to switch carriers. If I knew how painfully incompetent they were I wouldn't have gone there in the first place.",1
PRE PAID SIM CARD,"Very disappointing experience. Went to the Hobart city store to buy a prepaid sim card but out of stock. Was directed to order it online so I did. Confirmation email said the card will be delivered to my home in 2 business day, and I got the confirmation from TOLL DELIVERY on the next day saying they are delivering on the next day and ask for my permission to leave it here if no one's home. I replied right ahead and looked forward to my card on the next day. However, I only got a ""Sorry I missed you"" card in my letter box, I followed instruction to rearrange delivery online but the online instruction asked me to call TOLL instead. I called and they promised my sim card would be send to my nearest depot (a BP station) on the next day at 2pm. I head to BP after work finding it not there and called TOLL again. The customer service centre said THEY DON'T EVENT KNOW WHERE MY PARCEL IS and would start investigation! Oh God, I am waiting for a SIM CARD that I need for everyday uses!!! I called Vodafone wanting to cancel the purchase and get a refund so that I can just go for another company. Vodafone said it is not their fault and I can't get a refund until the parcel is sent back to them, and that would take at least 10 days. 
This is ridiculous! What if they never found my parcel? What if they claim it is collected (as TOLL now claim that they have a record that my parcel had arrived the BP already).
I understand that it is majorly the delivery company. But Vodafone seems don't understand how urgent the customers need a phone card and it is actually them to appoint that delivery company. It is so irritating to keep hearing ""this is not our fault"" and ""this is not about our services"". They seems to forgot that the promise to deliver the card to customer within 1-2 business day was made by them. This is very disappointing and irresponsible.",1
"Good, easy mobile service.","Been with vodafone for almost 12 months (this time). Previously I had many issues with reception with vodafone some years ago, vodafone allowed me to break my contract and they couldn't provide a good servica back ten.. Since that time Vodafone has clearly invested money in improving mobile coverage and now their service is excellent.",4
call center lie,"So i was lied to by vodafone to get me to go through with an upgrad on 4 services i have with them this was done over the chat window, when i pointed out they had lied i got a call from a call center supervisor firtly asking is f i had downloaded a copy of the chat transcript then telling me i needed to close the text  chat window as it was causing feed back over the phone lol they just wanted to make sure that i didnt have a copy of the conversation.He then said there would be a charge for cancelling the upgrades they had talked me into by lying.",1
Nice and easy Vodafone NBN,Signed up for a 50mb Service download speed is consistent around 47mb.,5
Shocking customer service,Went to upgrade our plan and then offered a tablet offer for 8months. Once receiving the device it turns out it was 3 years instead. Canceled contract but then they charged me for their mistake. No body can speak English properly and they never solve anything over the phone. Literally called over 20x about the same issue. Worst experience and most misleading people working on the phones. If I could I will give a 0,1
Do not trust this scam company,It was the worst experience with this horrible company who doesn't really care about clients. There are so many people from such country i felt they are really rude and unfriendly. I went to Vodafone in Indooroopilly shopping center a long ago. I asked to them to help me choose 1 of contract they said come back 20 mins. I hung around 20 mins and went back. They shut down for the day. I ask to in guy inside he showed me gestures 'x'!!!. Are you serious??? Horrible manner and horrible attitude. Do not trust any naughty humans...,1
Excellant broadband,"Very Happy with speed and reliability with NBN package. No email available but plenty of free ones  on net eg, gmail",4
Harrassing my kids. Broken payment systems.,"For nearly 8 months Vodaphone would not allow my credit card to be used on its website or in its app to pay my bill. Every month i would have to call and get some rude offshore call centre agent acting like i had stolen their first born child and demanding my credit card number. they are not supposed to ask for your number. Then i would ask to be diverted to the phone system for automated payment. The rep would then argue saying things like ""Do you want me to fix it or not"". I was unaware that customer service reps had root access to the secure payment system and could fix online payment issues. 

On a couple of occasions this led to the bill being overdue at which point they want to be your best friend and call you demanding money at all hours of the day. They also like to send the occasional SMS at 2am to remind you the bill is overdue. They also send texts of demand to my childrens phones. Even though i have specifically requested my number be the only point of contact. 

To resolve the late payment issue i went into the store. I informed them of the web payment issues and the rude calls and contacting my kids. They said they would pass on my concerns. I then offered to pay the bill to be told "" We will print it out but you have to go line up in the post office to pay it.

To top that off my 12 year old got called at 2pm on a Saturday afternoon to be harassed by an offshore call centre worker about changing all of our plans.

If you value your sanity choose another provider at all costs.",1
Negative 5 star,"Terrible reception and rude service from [name removed] from dispute resolution team. After complaining for 6-7 months about the network issues they still don't do anything about this and i am paying for absolutely nothing. If anyone ever talks to [name removed] from dispute resolution team, he will be the reason why people will leave Vodafone. Changing company right now.",1
Liars. Why no 0 stars option?,0 stars from me. Vodafone are the worst. I was pitched by Vodafone Chatswood. We have 16 devices with Vodafone. I've had nothing but broken promises and lies. Customer service is non existent. I had to work through linkedin connecting with senior managers to get any assistance. Still on the phone once a week to try and fix up. I will await the end of my agreement and never work with them again. I'm counting down the months until we can leave - 22 sadly.,1
Liars. Why no 0 stars option?,Several months later still struggling with Voda. Latest they refuse to call me on a non recorded number. I'm sure this is a legal consumer right. I've decided to go TIO for an independent opinion. Shame.,1
Overseas roaming,The $5 international roaming is why Iâ€™m giving 5 stars. As soon as I got off the plain my phone and internet worked seamlessly. There was not one point during my 10 days in Thailand that I ever had an issue. Since I nyeed to be connected 24/7 for work as well as use the internet at all times I found this to be brilliant. I was also informed of all charges via text.,5
"No Network, No Assurance on service, No resolution to issues, Doggy marketing to trap customers --","- NO clear voice over phone, Data speed is sluggish, Hardly any network, people call me gets ""switched off response"". this is happening from last 6- 7 months. They charge premium costs but provide very cheap service. Not a trusted brand.are experiencing"".. Standard and provides no resolution to the issue/concern.  Can't hold to their commitments to customer. 

Doggy/cheat marketing strategy to trap customers : They have this new ""No lock-in"" contract with Phone offer  with pricing around $1400+ ( 1 , 2 or 3 year).. where you are free to part away anytime.. However They don't tell in case you do so ( due to obviously pathetic network issues ), you will have to make final payment of reminder phone cost in ones off.  You end up stuck with company as cost of leaving is very High initially!!..

I have suffered a lot with Vodafone. I will not recommend them to anyone..",1
Great service...poor quality data.,"Vodafone has a brilliant relatively quick service centre. The people who take a customers calls are fast, courteous, helpful and all of this geniinely so. Top Company for service assistance. I have a slight anger management problem when it comes to not receiving value for money and on paper. ..40 bucks for 35 days of 17gigs data and unlimited local and national calls with some international  calls thrown in is a great deal...Download speeds are fine, when net is working.However...i use my data in conjunction with wifi so when the wifi isn't working or im travelling i SHOULD be able to freely roam the web. My phone is a Galaxy5 so there's no phone quality issue. And it doesn't  seem to matter where i am...quite alot of the time my data is slow...it sticks or REGULARLY drops out. Im not exaggerating...it's  so appalling ive actually been doing important business related matters and half way through, the net drops completely out and sometimes it's like that on and off for hours. I take responsibility for this but because of the frustration ive smashed two phones. Very expensive and have had to involve myself in stress management because of it. Consequently, i will be looking for another carrier.
One that works. This has gone on way too long and MANY of my friends tell me the same thing. I wish it were different because i DO like vodafone services and the package. The delivery of data...most important to me personally...is sub par. Pull your head in Vodafone. You're losing customers.",2
No coverage even close to the city,1. Coverage is really bad. Zero or 2 bars most of the times even close to the city.2. 4G doesn't work like a 4G. Gives speed slower than 3G.3. Customer service keeps you waiting for a really long time.,1

Overseas call centre India,"1st of all there is no commitment to customers. I rather speak to an Australian or someone that replies & makes/talk sense. every time I ring up there is always issues problems etc most of them are rude arrogant & control freaks over your phone account, typical overseas call centres! its very bad, had 1 Indian man block me from calling up again the customer help line to see about my account info, had to literally ring up the sales team instead to get me through to help... if your recently overdue' by 1 payment they don't help out but they more like tell you your account is in severe trouble lol & don't rely on incoming calls from people contacting you including emergency 1s they'll  restrict that too in most cases......."" not a 100% happy customer at all.",1
Really Bad Customer Service - lacking in communication,"I am so annoyed with the Customer Service of Vodafone.  I switched over to them on the 1st November.  I had to take a whole day off work waiting for the technician to arrive - which I later found out in the day when I rang them to find out where he was, that he had been approx. 8:30am.  He never once let me know he was there or that he had completed what he needed to do.  Now I find out that I have to pay 16 days of charges to Telstra because Vodafone didn't inform me that I needed to contact my service provider to disconnect the service with them!  So bloody annoyed with them!",1
Ripped off,They are ripped off. They advised me it is two year handset contract and when i ported out they said it is three year contract so they are ripped off don't trust them and be aware. Thanks,1
Worst network,Worst network one signal in even city and close vicinity switching soon goodbye vodafone. Grow up and fix this issue if you wanna stay in the market.,1
Overcharging -- ripp off,I was with vodafone  i was  24 month plan for 90 dollar for which i got 6gb data and unlimited local call and sms. my plan finished in April no one from vodafone informed me about that and they continue to deduct 90 dollars per month i called them on 4th Nov i told them the situation 6gb data and local call worth 15 dollars a month and they continued to charge me 90 dollars for that. Any how i confirmed with customer care team that my bill is paid upto 22 Nov. on 5th Nov i got very good deal from lebara mobile for 15 dollar month i got unlimited national calls and sms and 20gb data  on 5th Nov i shifted my number to lebara mobile. To my surprise i checked my statement on 9th Nov vodafone has deducted 85 dollars i tried to call them i was long waiting so i disconnect the phone. If you have left vodafone please check your bank statement because they are ultimate cheats.,1
Cheat customer to pay service that doesn't exist,"1. Vodafone told me I have to pay for some fees that I didn't even use when I told them I want to change my current post paid to prepaid. My contract has finished a few months ago and it just keep rolling itself. Called a month ago to stop the plan keep rolling, but was told to call later of the billing cycle. Called later The manager insist I own them money, and doesn't want to hear my argument, keEp repeating when are you pay, he said the only way to avoid this fee -goes to $77 is to sign another 12 month $40above contract.2. Vodafone charges a month in advance, but was trying to cover/hide it to cheat customers to pay more when it comes to exit. we don't own them any money! Our current billing cycle was paid last month! Everyone, be aware of this when you are leaving and they tried to charge you! We don't own them any monthly unless your current monthly usage exceeds the bill that you paid last month!",1
Rip off,"Incorrectly charged $149. Have an actual email from Vodafone stating theyâ€™d waive the fee but after 5 calls, 3 emails and 2 weeks they keep telling me they conveniently are not receiving any of my emails and will therefore still charge me to $149. It blows my mind how this has happened when they are so obviously in the wrong. Have been with them over 10 years and a completely separate grievance I have is that my account is in my maiden name. I have had to provide evidence of name change EVERY phone upgrade (4 tines in 10 years) and it is still in my maiden name. Feel like the company is a prank it is inconceivable how they could be so useless",1
If I could give a -1 I would,"Shocking network coverage and the client services is so dismal.  They promise to solve your problems but when you ring back there is never any record of it.  The managers are so rude, they refuse to give you their name which says a lot, they should be embarrassed. How is this company even operating? I will be walking as soon as my contract is up.  They are so dishonest and unethical.  For your own sake, take your business somewhere else. Their offers might seem like a good idea but you'll pay for it later on.",1
"Bad customer journey, poor signal",Cant do online activation if you're not an Australian citizen-which is not kentioned when you buy. You need your passport physically on you and then you have to go in to a store.,1
Amazingly terrible would give them negative if possible,"I got nbn about a month ago through Vodafone. It seemed good they told me I have back up 4G that works immediately. While I wait for nbn to come install in apparently ""two weeks"". I had to call them to book an appointment. Which was terrible the foreign guy I was talking to barely knew any English. Plus the fact that I was on the phone on hold for almost an hour before talking to this guy. Couldn't understand him he clearly couldn't understand me. Told me I got my information wrong and can't help me. I went to the Vodafone store to sort it out. I wasn't even wrong...  So I call them back once again. On hold for almost an hour before yet another foreign who doesn't understand me. Trying to tell me that we don't have anyone available to connect the nbn for me so tries to tell me to do it myself...  I gave it a go and surprise surprise it's exactly what I did beforehand. Still no nbn. Then he said okay we will get someone to you next Wednesday. 

I'm like cool great! Thinking better late then never trying to be positive and look on bright side at least something is finally getting done! I took a day off from work to make sure I was there for the appointment and they didn't even show up...  Then they tried to call me the next day while I was at work. Obviously couldn't pick up I'm working. They left me texts to call them back. In my mind I was like I'm not waiting another bloody hour for you to pick up the phone. So I will wait until they call me again. They did on a Saturday this morning at 7am. Like what is going through your heads? Who calls someone at 7am on a Saturday. Then because I didn't pick up they said they've cancelled my nbn order. Good I don't want to deal with you people ever again. Absolute joke.",1
Terrible customer service,"I've had multiple issues with the app not showing what it should. I've spent hours upon hours on the phone trying to sort it out, only for them to tell me to restart my phone again (newsflash, didnt work the first 5 times....). Absolutely useless, and none of the people I talked to had any idea of what had happened before them. Tons of time spent on hold. No adequate solutions, only empty promises of a call back.",1
Just Terrible!,"We just bought our $20 top up and in just three days i have never made any texts and calls, i tried to contact my brother and vodafone voice message said just 3 minutes of call left. What is wrong with vodafone? I will definitely tell my friends and family NOT to use Vodafone.",1
Disgraceful,The worst service coverage ever and I'm locked in for 12 months paying for no service. If i could give 0 stars i would. Money down the drain!! How is this company still operating. Feedback on here speaks for itself...dont do it go somewhere else..big mistake.,1
Excellent service,Been with Vodafone for a few years had nothing but excellent service. great customer service and tech very helpful. Great value for money on their prepaid offers..,5
Worst network provider in Melbourne,Customer care Keeps telling about network upgrades always whenever I complain about call drop due to poor network connectivity.,1
Unethical company,"Coverage was always poor,  thus I cancelled their service and switched to another provider. Immediately, they called to inform that I had to pay more on the next bill because their promotion ended. Terrible service.",1
Service is bad and reception zero,"I find Vodafone frustrating, I have no reception. I needed to put another Sim in my phone. I have tried to come to an agreement and they refuse to work with me. Never get Vodafone. It is wasted money.",1
Dodgy NBN,"I spoke to a sales guy on the phone, and he sold me on 100 MBit NBN, but failed to mention that max I could get in my area was 40 MBit.  After downgrading me it became apparent that the network feed was inferior, with failures to download email, and low-speed Netflix...  I gave them the opportunity to rectify, but they just failed to do anything.  So I canceled under my 30-day satisfaction guarantee.",2
Do NOT go with this company. Very unhappy ex-customer,"They're eager to sign you up, but after that, there's absolutely NO service provided. My phone calls would drop out or wouldn't even go through, people would try to call me and it wouldn't go through (saying that my phone was OFF when it was in fact ON). They thought maybe it was the sim, which was replaced and it still happened. Every time I contacted customer support, I'd be stalled especially when it came to cancelling the service, each attempt to cancel was stalled for over an HOUR. I ported my number over to another provider and it works PERFECTLY. And now they want to charge me an early termination fee for poor service. What a joke. Didn't even want to give them 1 star.",1
Very disappointed,I was refused help by a young Asian male who told me it was not his job to do so.,1

Terrible - Cellular cover resold by Kogan,"I subscribed to Kogan who use Vodafone services for a year.  Yes, it was very cheap which is great, ($16 for 17Gb Data / 365 days) but in terms of cover, it is short of terrible.  Cannot access cellular communications in many malls or just about anywhere out of Melb.  Drop oust and very poor net esp. when I need it.  Sadly I will not test out this again.",3
Appaling service,Appalling customer service at vodafone Cranbourne shopping centre. Spent over $1300 on a handset and screen protector. Few days later they wouldnt lift a finger to help with a service problem. No idea how to keep a customer happy.Its a competitive industry so off to Telstra.,1
can't trust them,I sent a WiFi booster that I didn't want back to them they wanted to charge me $180 after I did that I called to have it removed from my account they said 2 days they lied to me a week later it was still on my account ask them again hoping this time its removed,1
Worst customer service and company ever i deal with.,Misleading you all the time and charge so much but in return you got excuses from customer care and they start protecting there colleague's.,1
I wouldnâ€™t even rate them one star,"The customer service team located in India, especially the resolutions mananger sainath who had no idea what he was talking about. And was more interested in selling me more services, 0/10.",1
The worse piece of crap I have ever been client of,"Unbelievable, trying to cancel my account, go to their shop they cannot do it because they are a ""selling point only"" try it over the phone and after almost one hour speaking with a freaking machine I finally manage to speak with someone overseas customer service, which couldn't obviously help. After another 2 tries, I finally speak with someone who can cancel it, but not without bugging me for another half hour on ""why I am canceling"" and ""we can give you better"".  Finally, I manage to cancel it but on the following 2 months later to my surprise they still keep charging me my bill. It is about time the government put a hand on this, this needs urgent regulation.",1
"Useless, arrogant and misleading service",Placed an order for upgrade on Saturday 20th October 2018 while their website clearly showed 1-2 business days delivery. On Monday afternoon receive email saying expected delivery 28 November 2018. That almost 6 week away!!! Yesterday Tuesday the 23 October 2018 their website still shows 1-2 business days delivery while their arrogant and useless customer service keeps talking in circles above how they understand and I need to keep an eye on the tracking tool. Today on Wednesday the arrogant customer service thanked me for pointing out the delivery times while also pointing to the updated website where it says 2-3 weeks while totally disregarding when I placed the order.,1
Vodafone - Honestly Never Again!,Mobile phone priced way high. Problem and issues with monthly billing cycle. Crazy for $$ money. Poor network service.  Took my name spelling wrong & start billing me while I couldn't activate the account yet. Many more... Honestly never again.,2
Terrible worst customer service,I was going to become a customer and get an iPhone Xr through Vodafone on the 24/10/18But I ring them up the Indian guy on the phone was so horrible and so rude to me and was insisting I give him this pin even though I said I am going to cancel it because he is so rude I even said can I speak to the supervisor I asked 7 times and he still refused and wanted to process it through even though I said I donâ€™t want to get it now there was no apology then I ring them up again to speak to someone else about it he then transfers me to the supervisor who then hangs up on me I wouldnâ€™t recommend dealing with Vodafone even if they are the cheapest they treat their customers terribly if this is how you get treated when you try to sign up on a new plan id hate to think what it would be like dealing with them under a contract,1
No reliable 4G network.,"I switched to vodafone recently. I have 40GB data available per month. I was called its 4G and its excellent. I live in Clayfield Suburb, near to Brisbane city. But my device only show 1 point in network and when I surf any video using data it just show loading sign and it doesnot load. There is no point of data and so called 4G. Please, consider on it and make reliable network service.Thanks",1
Cancelled,"So ordered a new phone and 24 month contract online on Saturday. Heard nothing by end of Monday so called up. They could find no record of order despite order having gone through and being given a reference number. Re-done order and  Vodafone then out delivery address in wrong. 3 further phone calls to resolve that. Then received an email to say it would be 8 week suntil delivery despite being told on phone 2 days. Phoned up to change to another phone. Then recieved an email notification of original order phone was ocming but still in 8 week stime. Think we were up to about 9 phone calls and decided to throw in teh towel.

Vodafone - can you please try and employ more staff who can speak english and also maybe the occasional one that has a brain please?",1
The worst network company ever!!!,"They decline me for a phone and approved me for a sim plan only! I said never mind cancel it I wonâ€™t go ahead with the SIM card. Right after I went to Optus and approved me for phone and sim, next day I receive an email from Vodafone saying theyâ€™re delivering to me the phone I applied for!!! Now theyâ€™re charging me monthly phone bill and spoke to almost 10 customer service people and no one could resolve and cancel the contract they decided to give me!! Stupid!! Itâ€™s frustrating!!!",1
Bad service,"i recently switched to Vodafone and purchase a new mobile phone on a 2 year plan I then wanted to change my ipad over to Vodafone Get a call from there call centre saying I had to visit their store and go on a pre-paid plan as I had only just joined them and come back in 4 months and then I could go on another plan.  Not likely. I have now gone back to my previous provider an purchased a plan that includes a new ipad.  While they use call centres they just do not understand how to deal with customers Vodafone, your loss and I will leave you at the end of my contract for my mobile phone as you just don't get it",1
NBN Wifi Hub,"I have had so much trouble getting an NBN connection, not just recently when i moved into my new house but also 5 years ago when I moved into my previous place.  NBN is so unfriendly to customer expectations and it doesn't really matter who you go with - you end up with the same nonsense over and over again.That is until Vodafone came along with their NBN offering.  They offer a connection that you can literally walk out of the store with, plug in at home and be connected immediately (via 4G).  This means you can wait for the NBN snail technicians to do their thing without having to live without internet.  I could not be more happy with my vodafone nbn wifi hub connection and I only wish the service had been around last time i had to go through the nightmare that is connecting to the NBN.  Finally, after so many years one provider has takien notice of what Australian consumers actually want and is treating the internet like an essential service.",5
Useless customer service,Contacted customer service about some old bills I needed that I could no longer access through thw vodafone app.. Was told I would have to go into a store and they could print them for me as customer service cant access this info. Said fine and went to the store. Was told by the store that they need to request them from vodafone and they would be emailed to me within 2 weeks. Not happy but said ok. 2 days later half the bills I requested turn up in my email. Contacted customer service asking for the rest of my bills and was told dont worry they will turn up. 2 weeks later still nothing. Contacted customer service again. Basically told they cant help me. Need to go back to the store and request again and wait 2 more weeks. Asked to speak with a supervisor. Same things from her. Vodafone your customer service sucks. Give your people in customer service the tools they need to help your customers otherwise they wont be your customer for much longer,1
Customer Care Factor = 0,"Network coverage is okay (WA).Phone packages (sim + data + calls) is good.Customer service is terrible. In WA the economy has gone to the doghouse and itâ€™s taken lots of peopleâ€™s jobs down with it.If a customer is experiencing financial hardship Vodafone are just terrible! Here are your only two options:1) A whopping 2 weeks extra to pay your bill (from the due date, but only if you havenâ€™t asked for additional time to pay within the last three months). Seriously? It helps like a hole in the head, because we all know we only experience hardship once every three months and things like job losses never happen and are certainly never the cause of bills piling up. Once every three months an additional two weeks to pay helps- not.
2) Financial hardship solution from Vodafone, for example if you lose your job and are scrambling just to keep your head above water, is to give you a few weeks to pay your bill and bar your phone altogether! Thatâ€™s sure going to help me get that much needed job! Thanks!

Vodafone, my friends and I keep having these conversations but this time Iâ€™m not forgetting it- at the end of these phone contracts Iâ€™m taking my entire familyâ€™s phones to Telstra. Telstra know how to treat their customers and, unlike the black holes of zero coverage we currently experience when travelling around the country by car, Telstra will have us covered! And when I call them with the very same requests for extension of time to pay they are ALWAYS able to assist me.
Vodafone = 0 respect for customers.",1
Vodafone is crap!,Tried to recharge and got locked out of account. Got charged $2 for every rejected attempt. Money got put back eventually but too much hassle where it's not needed. Couldn't get it resolved when I called customer service. Too many technical nonsenses!,1
"Bad customer service, company supports criminal theft from customers","I have been Vodafone customer for many many years now.Up until this month everything was ok until Vodafone offered one of the monthly repayment deals. I excepted new phone and tablet on 2 years plan.After a month I received bill $1600 for September month alone. Than my wife received bill of $500 for same month although she is on prepaid deal.Vodafone argues that I have selected premium services and also my wife. I have no idea what are they talking about. I am 45 but certainly not stupid when it comes to scam awareness. So they took my money and today I terminated contract with them. Now I have to fork out another $1600 to pay off handset and tablet, and I just want to get out of grip of these criminals before more nasty surprise comes.
Never ever with Vodafone again, just like I stopped with Optus back in 1996 when they robbed me too. 

My argument is this, if Vodafone decides that I owe them $1milion or $1600 in this instance for next repayment than that is equally same, robbery, theft.
And what about that customer service, they were so happy to get rid of me, unbelievable.
Bye bye vodafone.

"Bad customer service, company supports criminal theft from customers","Hi. Vodafone decided to return my money back to me. Yes, my money, and after this bad experience I won't be coming back. After joining ALDI mobile I went to Kulnura and I was surprised that I had mobile service in bush. With Vodafone last call I was able to make was Peats Ridge petrol station. This year I had to drive 1 hour back from country to make call and 1 hour back again. Vodafone service range is bad.",1
"Bad customer service, company supports criminal theft from customers","Today I and My family went to Mt Tomah. I am with Aldi data so no problem at all checking my emails, eBay, Blue Mountains weather. My Wife didn't learn the lesson from her problem with Vodafone. She is Facebook junky, as we got served food she went for a photo to upload to her Facebook account but there, unfortunately, there was no Vodafone service, only emergency calls. Only then I remember how liberating is without Vodafone.",1
Really helpful,"I recently bought a Huawei Y5 from Vodafone and was not impressed with the attitude of the young sales person, so I went to another Vodafone store to get help, that guy had 666 tattooed on his forehead. By this time I was having a panic attack and wanted to throw throw phone away. Then I found Vodafone at Erina Fair shopping mall, the store closest to Target. A wonderful young lass by the name of Julie had me sorted out in seconds, she was kind and polite, actually they all are in that store. I should have gone there in the first place. I now love my new phone. It really does make such a difference when you go shopping if a store has friendly staff.",5
Fastest NBN service I've had,"I recently switched from Aussie Broadband to the Vodafone 100Mbps download plan.  The ordering process was easy and the router was plug and play, no major setup required.Once connecting my WiFi devices to their router, I've been nothing short of amazed at their speeds, even during peak hours (93 to 96Mbps down).Yes, they make you take their router, but I am okay with that as it also includes a 4G backup service (this sold me), should the NBN service fail, which provides peace of mind.You can use your own router if you want to and I was for a while, but only their supplied router is supported (as in phone tech support), so keep theirs handy if you want to use your own, as they will ask you to plug their back in.
There is no set fee, just keep in mind if you cancel you need to pay $5 per month, multiplied by the months remaining in your contact (for the router).  Given the cost savings of $20 per month compared with my previous provider, Aussie Broadband, I am more than happy with this :)

Just keep in mind that if you need a static IP address, Vodafone NBN is not for you as it's dynamic.",5
Awful service,Awful serviceThreaten if you don't pay straight away then you will lose your phone number {illegal under Australian law and not ethical either)Signal drops even in metro areas...Kogan is just as good but much cheaper.Awful online chat help... No discretion,1
Unreliable service,"I've been a long standing Vodafone customer well over 5years, throughout this time I've mostly been using the prepaid service which has performed well. However, in recent times, I'm discovering the connection line is dropping out frequently.  Ironically, with Vodafone support on several occasions. Hopefully, they improve their infrastructure soon.",1
Very poor. Don't want use this network again. Looking for other providers,Customer care team don't how to talk with customers. Last week i got a call from Vodafone that lady was very rude she think she is more smart and  customers are stupid.,1
Terrible,I have been a long standing happy customer until they cancelled my plan 2 times in 2 years.  The link they sent is not user friendly to find a new plan.  I'm not after anything fancy just basic phone and a little data.  Seems they are forgetting the little people that keep them running.,1
Misleading information,Crappy customer service.Retail staff provided wrong information so that I bought the products.Called customer service afterwards and was told to go back to the shop instead. They said they couldnâ€™t help. What a joke!Wish I could give zero star.Stay away at all costs!!!!,1
Very disappointed,"So frustrated with Vodafone! I have been with these guys for 10 years, trouble free until recently. At the moment Iâ€™m absolutely disgusted!",1
Bad service,"The worst ever phone company. Went to Fiji and got ripped off by Vodafone. Advice don't use Vodafone. We were going to Fiji and thought that we would change to vodafone as it looked cheaper. I bought a sim registered it and called vodafone in NZ to discuss my options. The man said I must pay now and when I arrive in Fiji I then text a code and it would be ready to use...simple yes?? I did that, got to Fiji texted the code and it said I did not have enough credit. I called Vodafone and a rude person told e that I used all me credit. I told him I had not even switched the phone on from the call to Vodafone in NZ. He was very rude and told me that he refused to refund me. I asked for his supervisor and he refused. Si i paid again and got the plan going. Aftera  few days the data was so slow we could not use it. I called and a rude woman told me the they use third party providers and have no control over the quality. I hung up and called my provider 2 degrees and paid a bit more and got great data and good service.  GOOD ADVICE Stay away from Vodafone....they are bloody useless.",1
Beware Vodafone hanset Insurance is junk Insurance,"Beware: This is junk Insurance: I took out Vodafone handset insurance for $15 a month on my sons Iphone 6S. It was stolen and even with Police reports and all documents the fine print of the Product Disclosure Statement (PDS) allows Vodafone to say the phone is now redundant, they do not have to offer another phone like a 7 nor a reconditioned 6S phone. PDS table offer is only $399 and a whopping $300 admin fee. The admin fee if I actually had got a replacement phone was only 150. So no phone but still have to make monthly plan and handset payments for the next 6 months of a 2 year plan.Always read the small print in the PDS.",1
Terrible coverage sydney inner west,"I have recently decided to upgrade my phone theorugh Vodafone and now realise what shocking coverage they have right in the middle of the largest city in Australia, Sydney. If you have ever travelled on the train line form central to strathfield and beyond the mobile reception is disgraceful. For a company of Vodafoneâ€™s size itâ€™s time they fixed this issue. September 2018",1
Not loyal to their customers,Iâ€™ve been a customer of Vodafone for more than 10 years.One payment I missed they sent me a text telling me they will disconnect my phone. No warning or courtesy whatsoever. You'd think they would be nice after being with them for so long.Iâ€™m moving after my contact ends next month.,1
bad service,went on holidays 3 weeks in western Australia coudnt  make or receive calls until got back to sydney  had network coverage in places full coverage but useless if you cant make or receive calls,1
Easy port over,Easy to port over from amaysim to Vodafone good reception in my area never had problems with Vodafone always been very helpful to me good staff need better coverage in rural areas other than that no complaints,5
Complete muppets,"Have totally screwed up my upgrade,sent wrong color phone(returned it) two times correct phone was not despatched then a duplicate phone arrived day after,now need to sit and wait for a courier to pick it up(8am-8pm) will not let me drop it off to shop and save me a day of waiting complete amateurs!!!",1
Worst mobile service known to man.,I paid for a $7 add on with the guarantee that i was going to get 2gb bonus. Instead after checking my transcations on my own credit card i got charged $30 and they couldn't refund me since the account was registered to my parents ages ago since i had the number from my early high school days.,1
Vodafone Store downstairs Marion S.A.,This is the small store on the lower ground mall.  Efficient and friendly service.  Nothing was too much of a hassle for them to handle.  They even gave me some bonus accessories free with my new phone.  I later had to get them to correct an error in set up and they handled this perfectly.,5
Misleading,"Signed up a contract only as was assured to try the service for free cancellation in 1 month (else would not have signed up), cancelled after 1st 18 days due to network issues and after speaking to cust care i ported my numbers to another provider in 20th day, they said as assured i wont be charged a single penny since it was not even 1 month, recently i received a bill with $500 (2 nos in contract) early exit fee. voda cust care mislead wrongly assuring its customer to jeaopardise the situation. Very disappointed",1
Internet speed is terrible,"They don't offer good deals to long service customers, yet they're always advertising deals that are loads cheaper than what they offer. Internet speed is ridiculously slow too.",1
Refund not given,"After finishing off from vodafone, I tried hard to get refund of excess payment made by me, but everytime I had to wait for long to discuss the option of refund, the customer care executive will end up saying that they are not able to excess or verify the account and advised me to go to vodafone store with proof, when I go to vodafone store at Fountain Gate, they always say 'we can't help you...contact customer care for refund enquiry'. Poor service, always harass the customer. On the other hand they will call; number of times to me to change plans. My number was [removed].Due to this reason, now I am with optus.",1
Every month my mobile bill was wrong and I had to call up to fix it.,"I was with Vodafone for about 8 months.  I can honestly say they are the dodgiest company I have ever dealt with.mpany to only have one customer service person.  Depending on his mood he would fix or not fix the data amount.  Maybe he could overcharge people at his own will and take the profits or got commissions or kick backs?  I put up with this for 8 long months.  How many ongoing services do you have where you have to call up every single month to amend a bill that is not consistent with the rate you signed up for?

The phone coverage was very poor.  It did not work in buildings or outside of major cities.  I would not recommend Vodafone.",1
Crappy service customer care trash,Crap rude bad service from customer care  person 3 times and in store many times they made mistakes on my payment account they have stuffed me around. Never will I use Vodafone crap company again. Disgusting unprofessional!!,1
Coverage woes,"Mobile coverage is good in major urban areas, but good help you if you need to make a call out of town (or even in a small town). If you need coverage out of the city be warned, but if your a city dweller they are ok",2
Poor mobile data,"Boy am i sick of your variable mobile data access which drops out multiple times a day, for long periods.  I have no intention of taking out another plan with Vodafone",2
Never Pre order,"I have pre-ordered my Samsung Note 9, and Vodafone charged me from the day I placed the order even though I have received the phone after two weeks. I am not sure why Australian Consumer afire do not see this unfair business.",1
"New number is not new, they want an extra $20 to change it","When the 2G was turned off, my Father needed a new phone. We bought him a new phone. The SIM card was the wrong size but he still had $20 Vodafone prepaid credit and he had this phone number since 2000 when he was Telstra. He ported the Telstra number to Vodafone five years ago.ew number (because Vodafone number) and said it would cost him $50, but they would only charge $30. He complained that he thought they would just be able to fix his existing SIM which had credit. They explained that he was getting the $20 back and only paying $30.
So he tells me that getting a new Vodafone number is the best option for him and he is happy with their service. 
Next day there is an advert somewhere and it appears that the discounted  $50 deal he got for $30 is actually the standard Vodafone  $49 that was being offered to new customers for $29.
So I sent him back to get his old number ported to his new SIM, but they could not find a way to help him. Obviously he is a low value customer. 
The biggest issue has been the constant text messages about failed banking transactions, debt collectors, urgent requests for him to update his details via link, etc.
I suspected SPAM but some of the messages appear to be due to this number being very recently used by someone else (or someone else is mistyping their new mobile number).

Good value service and improved network,"Decent coverage in Sydney. $5 per day international roaming, generous data and improved customer service from a few years ago .. Happy!",4
Really happy with service,"I've been with Vodafone for ages and have never had a problem with coverage. My phone stopped working and I went in and was able to upgrade and the new plans are awesome! I'm not even locked into a contract if I want a new phone I just have to pay off what's left of this phone, which is great for me because I like getting a new phone every year!",5
Dumb donâ€™t understand the English,Knocked back for a phone when I have a1 credit history when to optus got everything I wanted in 2 minuets passed credit check no questions asked,1
Debt collection scam,"My wife used a Vodafone package in the period of 2014-2016, we ended up the contract and moved to a different one in 2016. Now Vodafone trying to claim that we owe them a bill and hand it over to debt collection. When I ask them which bill I owe them they sent the last bill to us. I have gone through my bank statement and found that this already been paid. When I mention this back to them, now they saying just to make this settle pay only the last bill again? What nonsense is this?",1
Wish I could give zero stars,"Don't both inquiring online; tried to cancel a Sim-only plan several times which failed, and was continually billed despite having tried to cancel. When I contacted by phone, the gentleman was unhelpful and rude. Unbelievably inconvenient - and a huge expense.",1
Great company but need to check credit history for upgrades plans hahahaha ......,"I have been using Vodafone for past four years in Australia as a postpaid customer And i never missed a payment and never late neither a single bill. I wanted to upgrade my plans, so they said that they needed to check my credit history and declined my offer. So I have decided to leave this company for crap policy!",1
They suck,Absolutely the worst coverage and service ever.... Battled with them for 9 years and getting worse. Changed to Optus a week ago. Fantastic. Wont ever touch Vodafone again. Crud buckets,1
Unhelpful,"Went to Vodafone for a pocket WiFi - set up was easy, and no problem. Usage has also been fine. However, when it was time for us to move and we had to cancel the monthly 60$ SIM card, this proved impossible. Guy on the phone was very unhelpful and didnâ€™t give me any sort of instructions how I could cancel the SIM card for my pocket WiFi. Shame",1
Terrible service,I told them I couldnt make any international call to Hong Kong since last Sunday  and ask them to check if it's their network problem .They insists is my phone setting problem and make me try to call different people and I did try.My friends are using vodafone as well and they are having the same issue.if other people also have the same problem then would everyone are having the incorrect setting on their phone ?Spent more than 40 mins over the phone with them and have no result...Very poor customer service,1
Worst provider and service,This company rips you off has no reception anywhere customer service is rude and under trained have no idea what they're doing will never reconcile.,1
Vodafone terrible service,Vodafone has to be one of the worstest companies there are out there which for people out there could not recommend People choosing Vodafone for being there phone provider. They can claim they are providing best service showing best politeness with customers over in-stores or over calling Vodafone Customer care team. There resolution team are terrible bunch of unhelpful lots when wish for requiring 3G handsets moving off 2G network closure no longer does supports from Vodafone fails at worstest customer service and customer assistance in-stores wont ever improved. If people are with Vodafone I strongly advise you move your service/mobile number over another provider. There's many best providers out there who shows respect to there customers never rudeness. Ps. being with Vodafone for over 13 years which ended right up-to now 2018 for bad service rather being positive in what they do. Not choose Vodafone for your provider...,1
Consistent,"I've been with Vodafone since they took over 3 Mobile's customers. They are great value for money and if you don't upgrade every 2 years they throw in extras when you do! The reception signal could be better, but it's fine for suburbia. Most of the staff are super helpful, if not just go to another store nearby or come back the next day.",4
Misinformation! They told me one thing and did another!,"Before the end of my contract, I called to end my plan. They told me that my plan would end automatically and that I would not get billed again. That did not happen, and I was billed again. I called displeased and they said there is nothing they can do. 3 hrs of arguing and the best they could do was give me a 50% reduction on my bill! They acknowledged why I thought it was not fair, but still charged 50% of the bill. Not impressed - would never go back to Vodafone, nor recommend to family or friends.p.s. Telstra has some very competitive deals, with much much better customer service.",1
Wont let me upgrade my plan. Customer for 6 plus years,"Trying to upgrade my phone, been a loyal customer for 6 years now and coming up to my 4th contract with them. Went to upgrade the phone but have been declined due to not having enough credit history even though having 6 years of history isnt enough for the the idiot desk joeckeys running the awful credit union vodafone use. Will lose many customers because of this. Not happy at all. Do not recommend at all.",1
Terrible,"Vodafone has a major bug in their prepaid system but refuse to acknowledge it, many complaints online. I have done daily recharges where I received an extra 4gig or an extra 2gig that last for 4 days instead of 1, I don't mind the extra value but I mind when I recharge and don't receive the data or it vanished after 2 hours. They say it's my phone using all the data but I haven't changed my usage pattern and this still doesn't explain why I am receiving extra data that last 4x longer than specified.",1
Beware what is not disclosed!,"I bought a one month contract as my provider didn't provide international roaming. It was used for 5 days then cancelled. What they failed to tell me was the billing period was the 7th of the month- I needed it for the 6th of the month for 5 days. Therefore I had to pay for 2 months, despite using it for only 5 days. I was told just buy one month then cancel.  Clearly not, they just want your cash! What a ridiculous company and the sales people don't care just shrugged it off. Plus the phone service was terrible, 45 mins on hold to talk to an overseas person with no idea. NEVER AGAIN",1
Billing issues,"I contacted Vodafone to pay off my handset to reduce my debt on the phone. Instead of increasing it by $50 per month which I requested ( including my normal bill) they have applied the WHOLE cost onto my bill. $892.00 later they want to put me on a payment plan to reduce it. Threatened me with cutting off my service when all I wanted to do was reduce the cost of my handset. Have spoken to 6 different people and have not been provided any solutions. Basically pay the whole lot, or be on a payment plan. I have paid for the whole thing, I know own my phone and will not be renewing my service when I can get better deals elsewhere for less money and hassle. Feeling that i'm being punished for trying to pay off a bill earlier, you would think they would want that money sooner. 
Not happy with the service, wait times or how something so simple has become really expensive for me.",2
Worst 4G,"Worst 4G service right in the middle of the city. Absolutely frustrated about the service. Being a customer for 10 years, itâ€™s only getting worse.",1
Give it a go!,"Vodafone definitely ticks a lot of boxes. Good value for plans, good coverage, good online customer support, and that's just to name a few.reat for what you're paying for. I just upgraded to a new deal and it seems great. 

Vodafone even sends you a nice little email thanking you for paying your bill, even if it's a couple days late.

Vodaphones awful new policy - credit checks on existing customers.,"I have been a customer of Vodaphone for many years. I have paid off 5 phones and my account is in order. I went to get an upgrade and was told that credit checks would be necessary. This is so unfair (I have had unrelated financial problems in past so I wont pass a credit check). Not sure why existing customers are exposed to this. I think I will find a cheaper option (and buy my own phone). As well, they are unbelievably rude.",1
SHOPPING FOR NBN,I attended one of the stores in the Brisbane CBD to ask about NBN and 4 times I gave my address and the consultant couldn't get it right. The equipment on display was dusty and dirty. Good bye you have lost my business,1
Customer services is terrible,I called to upgrade today. The person gave me the price. Then when I said yes and to go ahead he then made the charge extremely higher. He then wouldnâ€™t go back to the original quote. I asked to talk to a manager who is busy and I am still awaiting them to call me back. I am so disappointed in Vodafone and I have been with them for over 10 years world wide.,1
terrible in-store service,"I went into the store with my husband because his cell phone broke and he wanted information if he could have another cell phone but keep the same plan, the attendant seemed to be in a bad mood, barely looked in the face, was without patience my husband and I were very ungrateful because he treated us very badly, that we are customers and we have a monthly plan of $ 200 each, I'm going to cancel my plan and I'll never use vodafone again because I think at least they should be nice and take care of everyone! Vodafone I think you are lacking training in your team this happened at victoria garden  store in richmond melbourne",1
A communications company that cannot communicate...,"and when they do, the caller is incoherent, confusing and rude.ervices, but next time I have an issue with Vodafone, I will be gone.  

I cannot for the life of me understand why they are so rude and do not understand ENGLISH and what foul language really is, if they want it, I will certainly giver it to them, but, for your information, USELESS is not foul language - its in polite use and its in the English dictionary.

Why a new number,I switched from Optus to Vodafone.  Paid my release dues to Optus and went next door to Vodafone in Eastland.  Had the same number moved from Optus to Vodafone.  The store took my initial $30 recharge and I was fine for 1 month.  Then I went to prepay my monthly Vodafone fee on line.  It didn't work.  I had to phone 1555 and try to sort this out.  The overseas operator took $30 from my Visa Card and I thought all was OK.  Having phoned 1555 again to ask why I still cannot use my computer to prepay they now inform me that I have a new cell number.  Good grief -  what has happened is so annoying especially when I directed the staff in Vodafone to keep my original number.  Now I have to go back to Vodafone in Eastland and try and get my old number back.,1
Just. Awful. Worst Customer Experience I've Ever Received.,"I switched to Vodafone thinking it might be a smart way to save a few bucks. What a mistake! Network coverage has been awful, and I live in inner city Melbourne and work in the CBD.ived so that I can switch to another provider.

On 8th of August I visited the Elsternwick store. A sales rep by the name of Arik Handleman was extremely rude to me. When I asked him for his assistance with waiving my break free he said that it was 'technically impossible' for anybody at Vodafone to waive this fee, and that there was nothing he could do.

On the 9th of August I tried to contact Vodafone through their live chat functionality on their website. The responses were very slow, and it took a long time to interract with the customer sales reps. Finally, after half an hour chatting with a sales rep, and just as I requested to submit a complaint, the live chat was disconnected.

Excellent service and data,"We live in a rural location and getting access to data is all but impossible (no nbn yet). Vodafone has a great deal for unlimited data via sim. Itâ€™s been the best decision to give it a go, we finally have unlimited internet and awesome reception so we can stream as much as we like!",5
No problem solving,"I had a plan that i missed 1 month of payment and they denied me access to my vodafone and access to my account, i rung them and everything and they ended up doing nothing this call took 2 hours and resulted in nothing so i decided to call it a night and resolve it another night, 2 months later i decide i need to get my phone to work so i call them and try sort it they now say that i have a 600$!! fee on my account, so i tell them its gonna take me a while to take it out of the bank so please hold it until next week, they agreed. Next week comes around and i have accumulated the money and called them to pay it off, after waiting for an hour they told me that it had already been sent to debt collections, this ticked me off because debt collections put an extra 70 dollars on top of my 600 dollar fee, to keep it shorter, after that it took me 4 more 3 hour over the course of a month to finally get my phone unblocked. Please learn from my mistakes and go with skinny or 2degrees.",1
Misleading information,"Have had endless issues with Vodafone form the time I changed to them.  Was told to get a new handset as the handset I took over was faulty.  I did as I was told and got on a new plan and was charged way more than what I agreed on.  But the new phone also had the same issue of not been able to receive calls. (I later was told that it was not the sim or the hand set, itâ€™s the network upgrades happening and that effected the calls)They do not care about the customer.  Tried calling many times and sort it out but they connect me from pillar to post and no body is willing to help.  I requested for them to listen to the recordings and check what I was promised, but they refuse to do so and I was told to request it through the communications ombudsman. 
Iâ€™m now in the process of contacting the ombudsman.  

I do not recommend Vodafone to anyone as they mislead customers and provide very bad customer service.",1
Got Ripped off,Got ripped off and sick of customers service in store and overseas call center that's hard to understand. Would not recommend to anyone,1
No real support when your GALAXY S9 malfunctions,I bought from Vodafone the super expensive Samsung S9 and four months later it breaks down.   I live in Perth and Vodafoneâ€™s support is to repair the phone in NSW?   No phone swap was offered.   The customer service is really poor.,1
The worst network operator,Network coverage is really terrible. I canâ€™t receive certain incoming calls. Just waiting for my contract to end. After that I will change my sim.,1
No Help With Premium SMS Fraud,"The patronising and condescending attitude of the customer service people (Australian) who are there to help is laughable. I reported a fraudulent charge for a Premium SMS service I have never heard of or registered for. I spoke with an off shore consultant and had to SPELL every second word. I asked to be transferred to Australia and was told it was all my own fault! I am not an idiot and didn't ""accidentally sign up to a gaming service"" as the consultant suggested. They have offered zero assistance and told me to call the scammer's listed help line. It's a SCAM!!! They are not intending to refund any charges or to publish a warning to customers on their website so I have reported the whole matter to the TIO (Ombudsman) ""coincidentally"", the day after I did that, I received a ""special offer"" for a discounted something or rather. Clowns.",2
Constant Mistakes on bills,I have been with VODAFONE for many years but I have to admit I was just one of those people that paid my bill each month with out looking through all my charges. Until recently. I have been getting charged an accessory payment plan which is $112.00 I rang up and after been transferred to several people who couldnâ€™t explain it they agreed to credit it. But only to recharge me again for two months in a row. $380 for a month for a mobile bill. $58 of it is to pay off the phone and I have wifi at home. Iâ€™m totally getting ripped off. But they canâ€™t seem to explain to me why itâ€™s so expensive. So over speaking to people who donâ€™t know who are not trained. When asked to speak to a manger they put me on hold for a further 30 minutes. Worse telecommunication COMPANY ever.,1
Useless customer service,"A week ago a lady from vodafone rang me informing me i am qualified for an upgrade, i had to tell her i will ring back as soon as i finish work. So i rang vodafone back and a guy answered, he asked my details, pin, etc. And i told him that im only just ringing back to discuss the upgrade eligibility, he then checked their system and said yes that's correct. So we proceeded and by the end of the call he said its all finalised and i will receive an email confirmation. So i thanked him for helping me out and all was happy! 10 mins later he rang again and said there was error on their system when he tried to finalise. He then said to me he doesn't know where the error is coming from and suggested i go to the nearest vodafone if i want to upgrade because he doesn't know how to fix it from his end. I was so annoyed because there is no vodafone store in my town. I have been a vodafone customer since 2011!!! And this is how they treat me giving me one option that is impossible! So now i cant upgrade unless i drive 7 hours to my nearest vodafone store! They clearly know how to make a customer hate them. I still don't understand why he said heâ€™s confused and doesn't know how to fix the error? And not given me other options!!! Ridiculous! Like dude, are you serious?",1
Vodafone T&amp;C is a worst ever I expected. I'm really disappointed their terms and conditions.,I want to clear my plan and they are not allowing me to cancel plan without exit fee which cost $299!!! I told them I want to clear all my plan dept.,1
worst network,Absolute poor signal + worst customer serviceCalled customer care from 6 months about the poor signal and got irresponsible replywe have to pay full amount of money and what we from them is  very very poor signals,1
Vodafone - disgusting non existent customer service ability - destroyed our business,"The only thing vodafone can guarentee every month - is a huge bill?Shop staff in sydney - ruined our phone settings - no mms or texts from october 2017 - january 2018

Our customers were really impressed ?? 

Need to teach them english first - hard to understand - indian-english accent

Really , I think they should just stick to stirring the curry pot .

The only thing vodafone can guarentee every month - is a huge bill 

Telecommunication industry ombudsman is the solution - followed by a class action court case.",1
No refund,"i made a purchase of a prepaid plan today. After i saw a lot of bad feedback for Vodafone,i really don't want to use Vodafone so made a phonecall to Vodafone for refund.Even my purchase wasn't over 1hr... the Vodafone staffs kept saying the sim card sent..Sounds like don't want to refund. already some people having same issue.DO NOT  make a payment before finding a feedback from any website.",1
Vodafone service,"I use pre paid on a E8 device, this phone has limited internal storage which slows the phone down, yes I know they have cleaning apps but after the clean the adds block it up even further. SD card makes apps not work. Connection is great in my area of Mornington VIC. I like the add on's they provide except your main credit gets used first defeating the purpose of extra data. Customer service is great.",5
Vodafone is a HUGE Rip-Off !,So glad after I switching my mobile phone provider to someone else after getting ripped off many years by Vodafone. Their customer service team's communication skills were awful... not providing enough information or solutions to save customers money. That's why so many of your customers are now switching to your rival companies and are happier than ever as saving their $$.,1
Are they really that bad?,"Ok, so I am aware of Vodafone's not-so-fantastic reputation, but recently, I had been receiving prank calls from overseas, and upon reviewing my monthly bill, I noted additional charges I did not believe I was responsible for. I chatted online with a Vodafone rep. and after a pain-free, efficient virtual chat and some research on their end, they immediately refunded the contested charges. Not bad, I thought, definitely deserves some kudos. Also, I have been with Vodafone for years and on the whole, the network is pretty efficient!",4
Avoid them!!,"No value at all from this service. The only time they provide anything resembling service is when they want to sign you up. After that, you are on your own.",1
Vodafone what a joke,Don't bother with online chat. The  lack of empathy or costumer service is a joke.  Do yourself a favour and don't bother with vodafone at all .Wasn't  just  the once off  either .I really think shockingly worst service I have received  in a long time. I never complain like this . That is how bad they are!!,1
They don't have any idea at all what is customer service,I don't see any point of saying what happened or why they are terrible. Don't want to waste my or your time. Simply don't go to them. Store or customer service centres both as bad as each other.,1
"Staff at retention was so rude and unbelievably asked me to move out of Vodafone, where on earth can","Have been complaining about slow internet, have been with them for years never got rewarded for that. Customer service is the rudest",1
Lack of customer service + Rude staff + bad quality of products especially ZAGG screen protector sel,"Terrible Customer service, Trash product of ZAGG screen protector is selling through Vodafone. Only Glass protectore $90. expensive, plans, I can buy this type of product for $10 from China town. Please do not lie other customer.",1
Inaccurate Online Data Checker,Review applies to their 4G network but could be applicable to their 3G.Speed and reliability is fine BUT i terminated my contract cos their online data checker is at-least 6hrs out of date...in other words the data usage shown is 6 hrs old.This makes a HUGE difference when your at the end of the billing cycle and your getting charged $10 (regardless if u want it or not) for every extra 1Gb.AVOID this Telco.PS: I was charged $210 early termination fee so that tells u how annoyed i was with this inaccurate online metering system (and excess data usage charges),1
No Answers,"Am a long term customer who has never been notified that I apparently owe them over $1200 that they can't even tell me for what phone number. I have had the same number with Vodafone for over 10 years and they can't even verify my ID over the phone, say I have to come into a store. Well hang on I work full time and can't - but you are more than happy to take my $90 every month that I have never missed a payment on.",1
This is good,The network coverage is good except some areas in Melbourne there is dropouts my plan is postlaid my plan is value for money i am so satisfied with the customer and support service,4
Lack of customer service.,"I have been with Vodafone for over 20 years continuous .I joined when it was Bellsouth. I mean how many people now days stay with a company from the start. Why do they say they are giving me a special offer because of how long I've been with them then you see on TV or people tell you that they have it as well. Thenthey say they will ring & they don't & you wait & wait week later you you ring & all the excuses why it didn't happen.  Different department should of range me. I asked why is their no follow up to see if everything has been sorted but no so I'm going to go to the opposition as Vodafone don't care. Shirl. T

Janurary 6th 2019 Update - Sadness 

Loyalty should still exists but big companies like the $ more. Some of the staff that are hired. Well let me say they need to view the standard of knowledge & understanding   very quickly. I know they only read a little but come on guys you don't  get loyal customers very often.",2
Value for money Bundle!,I got a new bundle offer from Vodaphone and was satisfied with what I got. The bundle included a band new iphone 8 and the RED plan. The phone arrived in 3 days time and setting up was easy. Have not had any issues yet. Coverage is pretty ok for where I am.,3
Dishonest telephone sales. Refuse to correct. Will never use again.,"Network coverage good. Postpaid $50 month to month Red plan. Poor value compared to other providers.Customer service terrible: From 2015 I had a month to month plan ($50 each for my wife and me). Unlimited Australian calls and texts and unlimited international calls and texts to 10 countries. I received an unsolicited telephone call from Vodafone this week offering an upgrade ""as a loyal customer"". I said I did not want to change my plan. I was told the plan would not change but would be upgraded and I would receive an email same day to confirm. I did not receive the email. Next day I received an email ""getting your new plan started"". The unlimited international calls had been removed and replaced by a cap of 600 minutes for my wife and 1000 minutes for me. I phoned Vodafone to complain but was told there was nothing they could do about it. They refused to reinstate my previous plan because it was obsolete, despite the fact they had misled me over the phone. They offered a $10 discount for the new plan, but I told them I would be going elsewhere if they did not reinstate my unlimited calls. They said they could not. I will therefore be leaving Vodafone when my monthly plan expires and will not be returning due Vodafone's unacceptable dishonest behaviour and unwillingness to fix my complaint.",1
MMS doesnâ€™t work,"Every time I try to send an MMS with my phone, it gets rejected. The Vodafone support tech said it was to do with their servers and that I had to take a screenshot every time I wanted to send an MMS. This is ridiculous.",1
Terrible service in every way.,Appalling so called customer service. No regard for long term customers. Extremely disappointing 'resolution' offered for over a years worth of problems. Would not recommend to anyone ever.,1
Worst service!,"Wanting to set up an Apple Watch under my plan, store told me to call the customer support team. Worst mistake ever, was told to call back later and was told I can call up until 12am. So I called at 8:30, got hung up on an advisor whilst I was telling him I was wanting to set up an Apple Watch, called again, same thing happened. Then called again and was told to call back tomorrow and when I tried to explain I have spoken to 4 advisors now and all I want to do is set up an Apple Watch. The advisor showed no remorse and was nothing but rude and arrogant.",1
Very disappointed with Vodafone's new mobile plan,Very disappointed with Vodafone's new mobile plan. It is very complicated to understand the actual cost and it is over priced with mobile devices. My wife and I have left Vodafone and moved to Belong. We will instead purchase out right mobile devices from now on.,1
They won't let you to go with any other provider or use your current phone number with any one else ,"I bought a $50 two year phone plan with Vodafone and I'm regretting for doing that!!!!After the last bill of the 24 months contract they put me to a $60 post paid 12months contract WITHOUT ASKING me!!! And we asked them to cancel it just after 6 days my contract was ended and they haven't cancel the contract and we had to beg them to cancel and retain the phone number, they said we can't use the phone number with any other providers, but my point is my phone number is not originally a Vodafone number and it was from GT mobile. I'm sooooooo REGRETTING for having a contract with VODAFONE!!!!!! I HATE THEM SOOOOOO MUCH!!!! The NON ENGLISH SPEAKING customer service is the worst!!!! They are LIARS!!!!! I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT!!!!!!",1
Not installment plan,I never like Vodafone services. They not give a payment plan if customer can pay a bill on time. They give an installment and extension after 3 months..in future I never go Vodafone.,1
Horrible worst of them all experience! And I haven't even got to becoming their customer!!!!,"I placed an order online through their website for an iPad. Wanted to go with space grey colour, but it was out of stock. Thought whatever, it's gonna be in a case anyway, checked silver colour, it was in stock so I went ahead and ordered it. Got an email saying my order will be delivered in 2 days. 3 days later having received nothing I rang vodafone only to find out that my order actually went to backorder because iPad was out of stock. A person I spoke couldn't tell me expected delivery time frame and was so indifferent to my situation that even said if you don't like it you can cancel your order. I decided to give it a few more days before cancelling, so naturally a couple of days later nothing changes and I called them to cancel. After jumping through a number of hoops again I was finally put through to a cancellation team member. The girl said she had put through a request and I should get a notification within 48 hours. Surprise - 48 hours later nothing comes through. I called them again, after spending 15 minutes on the phone trying to explain to three different people what I need I was finally put through to a lovely lady who firstly checked my file. Can you imagine she told me no cancellation requests can be seen on my file? Meaning whoever I spoke to 2 days ago did not actually put through my cancellation request and basically lied to me. Either way, this time this lovely lady assured me she did put through a cancellation request, gave me her name and service request number and said latest by Monday I should have it cancelled (I rang them on Friday morning). Fingers crossed, I'll check back on Monday. In the meantime, stay away from Vodafone! I ordered same specs iPad from optus on the same plan for the same money, and it got delivered in 2 days. Just saying!",1
SO disappointing,Tried Vodafone again with the 30 network guarantee after leaving 3 years ago due to no network coverage/ reception. Still the same issues. After complying with the 30 day network guarantee and handing the handset back/ closing the account way before the 30 days (and being assured by over 5 different staff members that there is nothing to pay in accordance with this guarantee) I am NOW (2 months later) having bills being sent to me for $100's of dollars for an account I no longer have and they are not willing to correct it. So unbelievably untrustworthy!,1
Not satisfied with customer care,When Vodafone have no customers that time took care but nowadays they don't care about customers. I have 2 services switched to another provider with a good deal.,1
WORST COMPANY !!!!!!!! do NOT make the mistake i made and go with vodafone.,"Someone scammed my account and has been using it without my knowledge, Vodafone was charging me an extra $50 every month and not once did a rep contact me about this error. They REFUSED to remove the number, It has now been over a year and I sent through all the relevant information last year in april which they have apparently ""not received"" even though I told them multiple times I sent through! I have since sent through the documents again this week only to receive a notice that Vodafone have sent a notice to debt collectors with MY INFORMATION for $600 when THEY HAVE OVER CHARGED ME WITH A FRAUDULENT NUMBER !!! I have spoken to multiple people who clearly don't know wth they doing only god knows how they have a job when they are all so thick ! ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY AND SERVICE !! I am still fighting for my money to be refunded and this WRONGFUL debt taken from my name.",1
Disappointed,"I got a text message saying-Vodafone had a little surprise for me as we were turning one year together. The little surprise made me drive to the closest shop (4km away) for them to say I have to solve it by using the chat (I missed time and fuel due to this). After one hour chatting with ""Farhan ..."" I got a little gift of $10 credit which was supposed to be charged during the next 24 hours. As it does nor happen, I contact Vodafone by calling now. They said as another person ""gave me the little gift"" they cannot do anything about it and I should wait another 24 hours to get the service. 
I have spet at least 3 hours for this gift which turned into a problem. This has been a terrible service and I feel so disappointed with it.
The performance of this platform is bad too. I had submitted the message many times and it always says there is some information wrong, when there is no mistake",1
Useless company,Changed over to Southern Phone & even though Vodaphone acknowledged the change over in writing they stll kept billing me $40 per month for a non existent service!Couldn't talk to an Aussie. Got re-routed to India. Still trying to fix problem. Stay well clear!,1
Hardship,I applied for hardship and went overseas for 2  week and I expect me to call from overseas which is expensive and don't feel comfortable but the staff said if I don't call within 7 days they will sent me to debt collection. Is this necessary?,1
Good customer service and coverage,I have been with Vodafone for 17 years and you need to try and get the best deal. Sometimes a few hiccups here and there but overall good quality customer service.,5
not recommended at all ....People careful not to jump into Vodafone pit holes,Ordered new Samsung S9 plus  however got opened box which was the mistake from toll driver. I sent it back to Vodafone and it took 4 weeks to get a new phone. I had to ring them nearly everyday. Each time representatives told me different things who were actually not tried to solve my problem. For the last 4 weeks I had wasted nearly 20 hours to talk to them to resolve my issue. Resolution team are idiots and very bossy. One of the resolution team members very bossy and adamant. Finally I had to talk to their big boss to solve my issue.I am really regretting with new 24 month plan.,1
Excellent Customer Service,Never had a problem with Vodafone they are far far better than Telstra.  Sometimes there might be a problem with coverage but as time goes on it is getting much better.,5
SCAMMING ALERT,"I just got a new plan today. I wanted a new Samsung Galaxy S9 and a phone plan. The adviser told me she got an ""absolutely great deal"" for me. $103.5 for a Galaxy S9 AND a Samsung A8 Tablet. This implies that $103.5 is a (one) package, or the tablet is a free by product by getting this deal. However after I received the confirmation, I only know that I am actually paying extra for something that I DIDN'T ask for and don't need. When I call back and try to cancel the tablet purchase (Yes it is a purchase without me realizing), I was told that I have already agreed to buying this product so there is no going back. I feel like I got scammed. This is not how it should be, it is tricking people to buy something.",1
Horrible customer service,"I was on a plan (month to month). Went away for a few months and had to put my service on prepaid. Then when I returned I had to sign up to new 12 month deal and could not get the month to month deal back. The problem was the incompetent customer service representatives. I'm currently on hold and talking to the 12th person.Hopeless, I hope I never have to call this organisation again. Find another provider!",1
Vodafone Insurance scam,"Talked into buying phone insurance by the rep, thought it was good idea, paid faithfully all the time & on time, it got damaged sent it for repairs, paid the excess, got a letter to settle for $274 on an alleged $1000 phone. People people, don't get Insurance from Vodafone its all rubbish.",1
Think twice - There are better service providers in the market,"I am on 24M plan with 27$ vodofone with very little data 2GB. For the same money, nowadays other service providers give you up to 15GB data, 100 min international calls, unlimited calls Australia. Even after several calls to Vodofone, vodofone are unwilling to provide me more data or international minutes etc. So be careful if you are signing for long term contracts any mobile service providers.",1
vodafone.co.nz worst customer service ever,"I incorrectly topped up on vodafone.co.nz mobile phone.refund.

Ported my number to other network, would never trust vodafone for any of their products... Total rip off... Does not seems like a big company, even  a corner shop provide better customer service and more reliable than vodafone....

Total avoid...",1
customer service - post paid,"Useless team member - name sathya, not a genuine person, big liar , not answer what customer really request. Talking nonsense he can hear what I can talk but just bluffing and cut the call",1
I've been scammed,"Took out insurance on a new i-phone 6, I always paid my bill on time (direct debited) then almost 2 years on the phone got lost and days later recovered destroyed, tried to claim insurance got stalled again and again and again and again, they just kept on insisting on more information, I went to a Vodafone shop in frustration and they told me they could do nothing at all to help me cut through the crap because insurance was with a third party, finally after many attempts to get claim underway they told me I need to provide them proof that I am actually insured with Vodafone despite them giving me a claim number on original call, what a joke they want me to prove that I have a paid up insurance contract, based on that I cancelled my direct debit with them, I had been paying insurance for almost the full term of my contract thus the replacement refurbished i-phone 6 had become almost worthless by now especially given that it comes with a $50.00 excess. (I had paid $15.00 month for almost 2 years without a claim) In frustration I cancelled my direct debit and naturally these parasites are harassing me now for payment, they don't mind dishing it out but hate it when the shoe is on the other foot, I will be reporting them to the ombudsman, be warned the insurance this company sells to you may be worthless which is my experience.",1
Terrible customer services! Lies everywhere! Be careful!,I signed up a plan recently. The sales person in store signed me up for protection plan without my knowledge. She only explained the phone plan and hid other charges and got my signature. I have been with Vodafone for more than 10 years and really disappointed and disagreed with this type of sales skills!!,1
Horrible,"Mobile service is subpar at best, customer service is the big fail. Some of the worst customer service I have come across.Would not recommend.",1
Sim Card FAIL.,"Absolutely Hopeless. As a retired NZer all ll I wanted to do was install an Aus Sim so that my phone would work when I arrived at the Sydney airport. I spent hours doing battle with it; on line it would not accept my passport details. It gave me an international phone number to call; all I got was the ""No longer connected"" signal. NZ fodafone tried, but failed and told me to set it up at the airport. I failed at that too; my daughter and friends in Aus eventually got it going for me; long after I needed it. never again.",1
Terrible,"I went in store to get an iPhone on a plan and was shocked to hear I apparently have a bad credit report which is bogus and so couldnâ€™t get a phone on a plan. I work full time, pay bills on time all of the time, I do have a great credit history but according to their crap check itâ€™s not. I read online and sooo many people have been saying the same thing had happened to them. I have never been with Vodaphone before and thought Iâ€™d give it a go but never again apparently!",1
"This is unbelievable, I highly recommend you should throw this type of service into the bin","Please, network coverage 0.Postpaid service 0.Customer service 1/5 ( at least they try but they don't even know their database is not consistent).",1
Amazing!,We were moving houses and needed to connect our new apartment to the NBN which we dreaded as we assumed would be a long and tedious process... we were so wrong. We visited a vodafone store and 15 minutes later were given a modem router and were told that once we got home we would be all set and ready to go! I've dealt with 2 other NBN providers and all times have been nightmares... it's nice to see Vodafone has got it right!,5
Worst customer service experience of my life,"Hands down the worst customer service experience of my life. I pre-ordered the Galaxy S9 back in March and it was sent out without a confirmation so I took it to a store (was advised to do so by Business Team) The first thing that the lady said to me was I can't help you and she literally turned her back on me and continued talking with another staff member. I then ordered a satchel online to return the phone and that went smoothly. Then I received a bill for April so I called (Another 40 minutes on hold only to be put through to the wrong department and another 35 minutes from there to get to where I needed to be) They removed my billing details and told me that I wouldn't receive anymore bills and assured me that it had been cancelled. Then I received yet another bill this time for May and it was somehow $15 more. So I called Vodafone again today to chase it up. First guy couldn't help so he transferred me (35 minutes wait) turns out he put me through to the wrong department. The member of staff that I spoke to spoke over the top of me and transferred me. Today I spoke with 5 different employees in 4 different departments and was on the phone for another 2.5 hours, to a telco that I don't use, to chase up a service that I never activated that I am being charged monthly for. To say that the customer service was abysmal doesn't even begin to cover it.

UPDATE 07/06/2018 Still battling to cancel my service and am now receiving emails saying that my account will be cancelled if not paid... I look forward to that moment but hope that it won't affect my credit rating.

UPDATE 05/11/2018 Finally just had my first month without receiving an invoice. Hours spent on the phone but so happy it is over :)",1
Long Term customer for 15 years and absolutely peeved with their service.,"Have been a long term user of vodafone besides the woeful issues in the past, always giving them a another chance with a new 24 month contract as a loyal customer.le during business hours, however they'll arrange for them to contact me...  A couple days later, get an automated call with a call recording telling me to press 1 to speak to their consultant, I select 1 and it repeats the same message, 3 more times and then the recording says they will try again later.  60 minutes later, another private call another repeat of selecting 1 to speak to customer service and then repeating they'll call me back after I kept hitting 1....  So basically the only way I can cancel the service with Vodafone for a service I'm unaware of and getting billed with $15 late payment fees, isn't even giving me the opportunity to cancel.  Never again Vodafone.",1
Contract Vodafone Sim plan.,"It works alright for me. I purchased student plan with 12Gb. I have never used them all. The 4G is quite alright with occasionally drop out. However, the signal may be weaker then Telstra as I always got no signal when traveling underground, but my friend who used Telstra, gets better signal. Anyways, no complaint and I feel this plan is reasonable, suitable for students need.",5
The worst customer service i have ever experienced,Worst customer service in the country by a mile. Not once have i been satisfied with any support from your staff.,1
Overpriced and not great customer service,"Was with Vodafone for about 6 years +.  Left them in Jan after being disappointed with their pricing and lack of decent offers to existing customers.  I found their service to be slow and often in my area I wouldn't get reception in my house (in the suburbs of Brisbane).  I tried of their 'customer service' call centres calling me to try get me to stay with them or resign a new contract, particularly as the deals on the phone were always different. 1GB of data, and used to sometimes run out just before the new data was due to start, and then they would top up a day before the new month and barely use 10MB., I said to them on facebook, why they couldnt charge me for the 10MB I used pro-rata etc.  Anyhoo, they did that to me about 5 times and this was the thing that ultimately lost me as a customer.  I believe they finally changed that policy, but it was too late. 

I left to go to Moose Mobile and loved them!",2
I was a faithful Vodafone customer... until now,"The other day, the customer service sound like a sales person. I agree to her plan because the plan is still the same. I couldn't pay extra due to.. I'm a student. I'm broke. I called another person the next day and they transfer me to a sales guy and told me to get extra data, extra money should be paid. And I flat out told him I'm not interested. Wasted 45mins. And then, I got a text about the product that I rejected.. that it is being shipped! I called the customer care and this lady told me that it is because I AGREE to the Terms and Conditions, I need to pay cancellation fee if I want to. Damn. I told the guy before her that I am a student, I'm broke, I don't need another tablet.  Calling me up when I have 6 months in contract is a definite disgrace. They should call us a month or 3 months before our contract about to go out. 

I am going to move to another phone company. Goodbye Vodafone. It's been a nice almost 10 years experience.",1
Coverage is terrible,"I have been with Vodafone for more than 10 years, but current Coverage is terrible, no worth the money, will not use this company after contract finish.",1
Internet is frustratingly slow,I 've been a vodafone customer for more than 15years. Lately i have issues with mobile internetVery hard to stream anything. Changed the sim card yesterday but issue got worse. Unfortunately I have 9months in my contract. Can t wait to get outI am traveling on Pakenham line to city. From Caulfield to city i wouldn't get any internet. Very frustrating,1
Terrible,They glenelg branch of voda phone signed my dad up on 12 month plan he is 91 years when i went next day with dad to get him out of contract they said we cant get out of contract he knew what he was signing but he did not understand that he was locked to a 12 month plan asked to speak to head office refused to let me talk to them said because he signed contract you have no rights to cancel contract. Don't trust these people,1
Definiton of AWESOME!,The network is for one extremely reliable and pretty fast.,5
"Good data inclusions, great international roaming","I recently moved from Telstra to Vodafone for a new business phone, on account of cheaper plans, better data inclusion, good international roaming, Qantas points and the 30 day network guarantee.The network coverage has improved markedly in the last few years.The $5 a day international roaming is excellent. I travelled to Europe via Asia recently and was able to use my phone as normal with no other extra costs and with my full plan inclusions. Amazing.My only gripe with Vodafone has been dealing with their customer support on the phone. Terribly difficult to deal with at times, very frustrating.The business team are quite good though.",4
Why do vodafone offer so little data on prepaid?,I'm currently buying prepaid for my phone. For $50 a month i receive a miserly 8.5 Gb of data. I see vodafone is now offering 40 Gb of high speed data per month plus unlimited data at a restricted speed as well as a new phone for their $60 plan. I don't wish to go on a plan but may consider it. For $50 a month i would consider 15 or 20Gb to be more reasonable. I'm supplying my own phone. I have always found Vodafone service and network to be very good.,4
Watch your bills!,"Was just refunded $60 by Vodafone for a year of Premium SMS from a third party provider called ""Pocket Skill Mobile"" that I did not solicit (didn't even open the messages - charged $5 each). Let's hope the federal regulators investigate Vodafone (like they just nailed Telstra). My advice for those also caught up in such a scam - contact the Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman, they were very helpful!",1
I wish I could rate 0 stars !!,Vodafone so disappointed !!! Today I went got myself a prepaid sim for my pocket wifi on the packaging it states the $50 gets you 24gig data. Once I activated the sim all of a sudden itâ€™s only given me 10 gig data because apparently the 24 gig is for mobile phone usage only which that does not state on the package!!! I called Vodafone to complain about this and they basically didnâ€™t care and didnâ€™t want to help me! Iâ€™ve been your customer for years but I certainly donâ€™t know about that anymore!!!,1
"Shocking customer service, waste of time","Shocking Customer service. I phoned vodafone on behalf of my grandmother who doesn't use a computer and knows very little about phones. She also lives 2 hours from the nearest vodafone store. Overall i spent 5 hours dealing with vodafone only to be transferred to 9 different operators just to upgrade a phone plan. The first phone call took 25 minutes when the phone cut out. I then called back to explain my request to another 3 different operators. My request then progressed until i had to do a credit check. I was told the credit check team are busy we will call you back in 15 minutes. 2 hours later i still haven't heard anything. I phone again and explain the situation to another 2 operators. I then have to start the request all over again. Eventually the request was complete so i am transferred to the sim swap team to activate a new sim. This team kept transferring me to an automated system to activate my sim. After explaining that the automated system doesn't recognise my number i once again was transferred back to system. After 4 phone calls to activate the sim i was told by a rude and a pushy woman ""it takes 24 hours from the time you upgrade the plan to be able to activate a sim. So i wouldn't be able to activate the sim online or over the phone"". Would have been nice if the first 3 operators had told me that?! Meanwhile another family had activated the sim online. So none of the information i was provided was correct. Their phone line was also shocking, echoed, cut in and out and was very hard to hear the operator.  Comparable prices to other phone providers so look else where for better and accommodating customer service.",1
A good change from Telstra,"The network coverage has definitely improved over the years, I don't have issues with it unless I'm in very remote areas. Value for money is a lot better than what I had before. $40 gives me over 12gb for over a month and I got to keep my phone number when I switched from Telstra which only took a couple of minutes. All in all very satisfied customer.",4
Team that avoids responsibility and problem solving.,"After months of having my phone lost in transit-by the companies poor choice of delivery company. The team at Vodafone did not feel that 5 minutes problem solving was worth ensuring my phone was sent via a delivery company that has a proven track record. Send items to repair at own risk and prepare for daily emails that solve nothing and workers who will avoid responsibility to solve problems.to send my phone THE EXACT SAME METHOD that has failed! WITH THE VERY SAME ONE STAR RATED DELIVERY COMPANY. It would take them 5 minutes to try an alternative that does not affect them, but they have such inflexible procedures the advice after weeks of attempts is to..WAIT FOR THE SAME COMPANY or pick it up far, far away from where I live (Port Melbourne).

All the while, my monthly bills have been paid, 300 dollars and counted on nothing. On waiting for a phone that does not seem to exist.",1
Horrible and very rude customer service,"Vodafone store at Ashfield mall misleads customers by giving all false promises. My father bought a prepaid new sim card and paid $40 in the store. He was promised that the sim will get activated with in 3 hrs. So we called and were told that it will take another 24 to 48 hrs so we waited patiently again. It didn't work. We went to the store and asked again. We were told that this time it will work 100 percent. And again it didn't work. So we went to the store again and we were told that its going to take a week now as there is some network issue. so when we asked why was it not told to us that this could happen  before selling the sim to us, the guy at the store  (looked like he is from India) said that's not his responsibility and can do nothing about it. He was so rude and not wanting to help as said he is busy with other customers. Such an irresponsible guy. Vodafone is one of the worst services ever. Males people fool. Will never recommend anyone to use this product.",1
"donâ€™t trust them, say one thing do another","Iâ€™ve recently been charged by Vodafone for $100within 2 days for data usage. It suddenly happened and never happened before! I rang Vodafone and they told me to change settings and I followed, the data still was running. I rang again on 19th April and talked to Minar from Customer care team. Minar has mentioned to me that my plan is old and if I moved to a new plan $40 12mth sim only and he will take care of the charges and I only need to pay $10. But I didnâ€™t say yes to change the plan as I am not farmilar with what I will sign. I triple checked with him if I call back this will work and he said yes and he will leave a note in my account to take care of the charges. I called again in the morning of 23rd April, then the whole team turn around saying there was no such note by Minar and he only mentioned about the plan change not credit of th data charge. Iâ€™ve been transfer to an Aus team based in Tas and was advise to have a call back by COB today, no phone call. 
Iâ€™ve rang again at 6pm, this time the person talks without understanding what I have been offered and saying thereâ€™s no such offer.
They have said really good thing about the charge to send me away then turn around saying no offer. They refused to retrieve the recording bevecuae every customer asked for retrieving th recording. I donâ€™t think this is a good way of providing customer service!",1
Lied to by Vodafone staff,"Purchased a Vodafone one month travel card for my son. questioned staff several times that the initial payment was a once only payment and Staff guaranteed me this was correct. Having checked my cred card after my overseas trip advised Vodafone taking payments after the month expiry. Tried to cancel the account that they opened and after 4 attempts i had to close my credit card to stop further withdraws.Eventually made contact as they wanted more money after advising the Vodafone customer relations person what had happened she advised she would delete the outstanding amount and ensure this was the end of this claim from Vodafone. Now have threatening letters and dept collectors threats Vodafone has really shown what a threatening and  deceptive company they are. i would offer the warning do not sign anything with Vodafone

May 5th 2018 Update: Lied to by Vodafone staff

Vodafone thank you for passing me to a dept collection agency especially after you Vodafone staff lied to me regarding the service i purchased from you. I thought you would have preferred to investigate the accusation i lodged with you Vodafone regarding your staff. I am contacting you to advise one of my  post's  regarding your outrageous conduct has now been view on one site alone by 864 views fantastic response from the public don't you think. I will keep you updated from time to time so you are aware bad news travels fast. Peter",1
Upgrading Mobile Phones,"Due for a upgrade of my ""Mobile Phone"", the sales assistants, knowledge of the new models was very good. He provided information on all the new features.First he asked the type of phone, I was looking for; after showing me the latest models, he provided me time to play with the phones and there was no pressure, to make a decision quickly.Answered my question about roaming on the phone when travelling to America in July 2018.Very happy with the service and the new phone.",4
They  are so fraud,I signed for 40 GB data at Vodafone store then i only received 30 GB. I called customer care 4 times and wasted so far 60 min on talking to them but not resolved yet. i need to make call again . it is been more than a month.,1
Been with Vodafone for more then 10 years.. Never again.,"I have been a loyal Vodafone customer for more than ten years and I recently decided to upgrade my phone to the new Samsung. During the conversation with Vodafone,I felt that the original sales person used pressure sales tactics to get me to commit to to the new plan and change my families sim card plans. We have a total of 4 sim cards. so after many calls to Vodafone I decided to go elsewhere. 

I called Vodafone to inform them that I would be leaving and to discuss the final bill. Whilst they did attempt to retain my business, they could not match the much better plan that I had found with Virgin. I made enquiries as to what my final bill would be and I was told as I am post paid that and due to their billing system being charged in advance, I would only have to make the remaining phone payments. 

With that in mind, I cancelled the plans and have now been slugged with a $450 early exit fee for 3 of the plans. Obviously I am not happy and I have made the decision that I will NEVER return to Vodafone in the future.

Their plans are not competitive, look around and you will be sure to find better plans and value for money elsewhere.",1
Pathetic customer service,"Customer service is very rude and has very bad attitude towards customer on call. The customer service rep on the call was not at all helpful, in fact these guys will irritate you and would try anything to get over with your call. Don't fall into their trap especially with sales guy who try to sell their services, later on you will realise how bad they are in their service and will leave you disgruntled. Do not get into contract plan with this company!",1
Worst Customer Service ever,"Being a loyal customer with Vodafone for more than 4 years, I was looking for upgrade options. I requested the guy the best deal and options in Vodafone, after a very long hold the guy comes back with a phone and a tablet deal. I told I only need a phone and not a tablet, another long hold and the guy comes back saying I get the plan for $115. I asked if there is any loyalty discount, after another long hold he comes back saying the deal after discount is $112. SERIOUSLY VODAFONE. After wasting 40mins on the call, the guy didn't even have the patience to wait till I finish what I am saying and he hung up on my face. That's good customer service.!",1
I'm in tears how could service be so bad,"Feb 2018 trying to cancel a month to month plan after the passing of a loved one using the plan, 45 minutes later I am left assured the number is cancelled.March 2018, they have put me on another plan and billed again. called and discussed put on hold, they pushed me to tears. Once again they told me all good number cancelled.April, yes I get another bill NOTHING is cancelled. I get the fella to read the notes, he does then he puts me hold, can not explain anything and tells me he needs to put me to the cancellation team....... OMG really.Finally once again I cancel the number. I have no confidence and will not be surprised if I get another bill in May.",1
Putrid Company,"The Call Centre is unbearable, they Cut you off if the Question to Hard. Can't understand the Lingo, have to pay the Bill 2 weeks early before data is used. or be fined. The bills are incorrect every month so I have to ring every month. Warning if your Bills is inflated so don't pay it and ring them, they do it on purpose hoping people will just pay the wrong amount. There should be an Investigation into Vodafone they are scammers.",1
Upgrade weekend means no activation or service for anyone.,"I purchased a prepaid SIM card yesterday morning for the 4 days on holiday I have. After not being able to activate the card because I have an international address and no Australian address, they told me I could go to the store the next morning and get it activated. Once at the store, Sunday am at 10am, the activation systems were down for an upgrade. I had to leave to go on a Harbour Cruise and they told me it would be back up in 4 hours. I am now back, 7 hours later and there is still no activation service. I will be on a tour all day tomorrow during store open times and thus it looks like I wonâ€™t get service until 2 days from now. That leaves me 1 day to use the terrible service they are providing. Hope they enjoyed taking my money for nothing.  If you canâ€™t support your product, then donâ€™t sell it!!",1
Problem solved.,After a few days calling and struggling to solve my problem they came out with a good solution. Service is ok.,3
Absolute junk!,"Network coverage in WA is crap, constant drop outs in heavily populated areas, worth paying the extra to be back with telstra!!The staff with Vodaphone do not help simply pass the buck and tell you there is nothing they can do, for a telecommunications company in 2018 that is an annoying poor excuse!",1
"Great Telco, reliable service and decent value","I live in the inner South East of Melbourne, always had reialble service and great speed with data allowance and costs that we're among the more reasonable available. Very happy to recommend to others.",5
Great so far!,"Recently changed from Telstra to Vodafone. Paid off my phone with Telstra and they advised my plan would only reduce by $5.... also went in store to discuss and they advised me to just go online, lost me there! Went to Vodafone, got hooked up with new iPhone 8, and paying $15 cheaper than my old 6 i have already paid off! Service and connection so far amazing have been really happy!! Switch over people!",5
Recharge difficult &amp; connection reliability also questionable,"Numerous times I've needed to use the recharge service for internet/ data. It is very inconvenient in the middle of studying online to not have your mobile phone provider offer reliable & consistent recharge services. Always technical issues over the weekend when trying to recharge-  to continue not only as as an online student who needs the internet, but as someone trying to get home on public transport & communicate whilst doing so. Too many times now",2
Very hit and miss with the customer service.,"I purchased my iPhone 7plus through Vodafone a couple of months ago. I took it out of its packaging and turned it on only to find it had a permanent line across the screen and ended up malfunctioning. I returned it to Vodafone and was told to go directly to Apple who would replace it for me. I felt that this was not right however was unsure so made the trip to the Apple shop. They told me no, as I suspected it is Vodafone who need to replace this. I returned to the Vodafone shop and told the employee this and she said 'oh yes, we can return it for you'. Needless to say I was extremely annoyed. This experience and the way I was treated was upsetting so I decided to go in to a different store. The staff there were very helpful and explained everything clearly to me. It is this reason I have given them a 2/5. Very hit and miss with the customer service and staff knowledge of procedures.",2
Great service always reliable,I had the 40 DATA COMBO plan and always comes with EXTRAS. 9 GB extra per month when you recharge online. So 18 GB for 40$ not too bad hey.,5
All time liar,This is company every time lire and every time misguided customer's so I request not use Vodafone company's acc to me this failVery bad guidence,1
Worst support ever,We called the support and after we got promised a refund we didn't get anything. Then they told us to go to a store to get it fixed. When we got to the store we were given the same number we just called. And they promised us we would get a refund. We called the number again and we couldn't get any refund at all.,1
absolutely disgusted_ worst service no assistance,"Im on a prepaid arrangement with vodafone coverage in the area is average, however service is terrible. Family member bought a new phone and needed a new sim to fit device. I went to the store to pick it up (due to mobility issues the sim owner could not go to the store) I was advised that the sim could only be registered if the person physically present in store. I informed them that the policy did not account for people with disabilities. I took the sim. In an attempt to register the sim through myvodafone account the site experienced technical difficulties and a call needed to be made to the service center. As the sim was registered 18_20 years ago the four digit password was not remembered and therefore no assistance was provided except being informed that we had to go to a store to be identified.
website issues were resolved and we were able to register the new sim....next issue all incoming calls were being diverted to voicemail identified that it was not a phone setting and therefore was an issue with the sim, called vodafone but due to not having the pin no assistance provided. I disconnected the call (after saying what i thought of the lack of service and assistance) received a message back saying we tried to call but can not get through...which was exactly the problem no calls can get through. My family and I have paid for services from vodafone for at least 18 years...waiting for the last of my credit to be used and then no more.",1
"Dishonest, misleading, criminal.","This is the first time I've ever written a review about anybody or any company.re have the same name but unless you read the intricate details he would not discover the big difference.

Very unsatisfied long time Vodafone customer who is very disappointed with the way they treat people and as I said in my introduction they are borderline criminal in the way they get away with this. My advice to people is go to the telecommunications ombudsman, give them your grievances and don't accept this behaviour or they will keep doing it and that goes for all telcos.",1
Used to be great. Not anymore,"I've been a Vodafone customer for over 15 years. Used to have fantastic customer service but now it's very bad.Phone calls break up/drop out often.Data is good then drops off. I would call and complain, data would be good again then pan off. Constant battle.I have now changed to Telstra",2
"Do not buy Vodafone Prepaid, they will not Activate! SCAM!","I bought a $50 Vodafone SIM,  it had no Expiry date listed anywhere, yet when I tried to Activate it, it said ""Expired SIM"".  When I rang them, the INDIANS on the Customer Service line didn't want to help at all.  SCAM!",1
security is terrible,i was part of the vodaphone security leak. had my identity stolen and everything taken away from me. would never recommend this company to anyone. they need better protection for the consumers.,1
Worst network most expensive,Lost money because their network was not functioning in the melbourne city. They frequently get network outages at whim. They dont care about their customers. I changed my mobile device but still same result. I decided to change to Dodo and i m happy with their prices and network.,1
worst network of australia,"3 weeks ago, I bought iphone 12 pro  with vodafone $45 plan ($5 discount, so it costs me $40). For every call i receive or make, i need to get out of my home into open space and talk, otherwise it is consistent voice dropping. My wife has a boost mobile prepaid card and she gets 123 Mbps internet speed while inside home and i get  between 2 to 3 Mbps. Vodafone plan offers 60 GB data to me and I am not sure with such a poor speed , how am i going to even consume that. I am not sure what i am paying this much amount for. My wife spends just $15 a month and her plan is far better than mine. Vodafone offers network like third world countries and their charges are like developed country. Since I bought this phone, i m not even getting basic phone call service properly, what else i can expect from vodafone. I am leaving in Eight Mile Plains and it is no way in outer suburb of Brisbane.  I called customer care and they provided me standard answer that they have network upgrade going on in my area which will take long time. They didn't give any ETA. I believe i would end up paying them in $$$ by the time their network upgrade finishes and my plan of 3 years would also get finished by that time. I believe this is the standard way of answering to cool down customer and they must be using this tactics since many years. They will never have network upgrade I assume. If this is the service in my suburb, i can assume how pathetic it would be in other farther or remote suburbs. Vodafone is 10 years behind than Telstra and Optus in terms of technology upgrade.",1
Conned,Wife called into Vodafone at Victor Harbor several days ago because Google and Yahoo Mail wouldn't work on her 1.5 year old phone. The Guy in the shop didn't check the phone and told her that the phone was too old to run the apps and sold her a new phone and extended plan.It too me less than five minutes to fix.I cancelled the order.What is really going on here. Are they totally incompetent or extremely dishonest. Either way you wouldn't deal with them.,1
Plan Change - Pure Frustration,"Want frustration .... try changing your phone plan. 2 hours on the phone, 1 hour on the internet, 5 service providers ... each of which asked me to verify my identity, 4 credit checks,  all for nothing and no result /:()&&&(;:/-",1
Plan Change - Pure Frustration,... and in addition they severed my existing operational internet connection .... leaving me with no connection and no service ..... thus removing the existing credit that l had on that account,1
Plan Change - Pure Frustration,If someone wanted to provide a worse service experience l donâ€™t think they could exceed the example set by Vodafone,1
Unreliable service,Purchased an iPhone 12 from Vodafone in a city in January 2021. The phone stopped working in March 2021 and Vodafone has been contacted several times but no reliable response has been received so far.,1
Selling warranty expired items part of 24M plan - Shame on you Vodafone,"I am very disappointed and surprised to find out that my 8 years old's daughters watch I bought part of 24M plan only got warranty for 12 months and money greedy Vodafone is asking extra money to fix the issue. This is very unethical as if provider is selling a 24m plan and hardware cost is included in the plan, they should cover it until the plan end.",1
Taking money without permission.,"I added my card details to make recharging quicker. But Vodafone started taking money out automatically. I called them to ask why and the guy in India? said I had done it myself. Which I hadn't. Then he rudely suggested that I should ""try"" listening to him. As if I hadn't been ?!?I have had little trouble with Vodafone in the past. Unless I travelled interstate, then service was different.Just be careful adding a card to make things faster. They will take your money without asking.Kind regards. Anthony.",2
Worst company. No system at all in place. Wrong misleading information,Worst customer service donâ€™t use Vodafone,1
Excellent in every way!,"I went in and spoke to a representative Danny Elle at Colonnades South Australia.She answered every question and wrote the answers down for perusal later.Very helpful, why would you want to get a phone from anywhere else.",5
1 star only because there's no ZERO option.,"It is unbelievable that I've gone from a long term loyal and happy customer to someone so extremely frustrated and upset by poor customer service that i have actually requested to return a new boxed handset and terminate my contract.Back story:Although I had zero coverage during my Oct'20 holiday to Monkey Mia, I must say I held firm as a loyal longterm customer of 3/Vodafone when ppl told me to switch.  So much so that when I received an unsolicited call from their customer sales team recently, I decided not only to switch up my plan but also add an expensive handset to my account (I usually always buy handsets outright). 

However, today I received the worst customer service from Vodafone when trying to rectify my situation brought about by being given misleading incorrect information during the sales process.

Instead of receiving help I was passed from operator to operator and given the runaround. I was even put through to billing and subsequently hung up on because the office was closed.  I was also given
inconsistent information between the several operators on the phone which most frustratingly also differed from what was told to me in-store. 
After 2 hours of what should be a simple process turned out to be complicated and convoluted. I think they do it this way to trap you but seem to forget that customer a have rights.

Terrible experience,"I moved to Thursday Island in November 2020, where there is no vodafone coverage. I was on $45 plan plus iPhone paying monthly.  Vodaone let me have $10 plan just to let me keep the excising Vodafone number and paying the iPhone monthly.ain. 

 Vodafone telephone operator from India told me that I have been calling from Vodafone to some other numbers every month and they can trace them. They won't change my plan back to $10. I thought that was very strange because my iPhone didnt have the vodafone sim card. There is no way that I could make a call from Vodafone number. 

No matter how I explained to the vofafone operator, they kept saying that I had to pay $40 lite plan from now on. There is no vodafone coverage in Thursday Island. How can I get benefit from $40 vodafone plan. I am using $10 Belong sim card and I cannot use Data, I am only able to make a telephone call from Belong number. 

 It was so frustrating to talk to Indian operators. In the end I decided to cancel the vodafone and just pay the remaining balance for my iPhone. I called for the 3rd time to vodafone to cancel my contract, the guy from cancelling team suggested that he will bar the usage of my vodafone number so that there is no more mysterious usage on my vodafone number.

GREAT DEAL!,"Advrage 20-25mbps speed, but i have seen it reach speeds of up to 90mbps in good reception. This service finaly allowes you to do mass updates like the 77gb star wars battlefront 2 update.Speed is awsome! And great deal! The only downfall that effects me is that the coverage is not crazy, if i use my internet while my phone is in the center of the house i only receve 3mps but if i put my phone near a window it can run up to 90mbps, and advragely runs at around 25mbps im guestermating, well thats what i have observed, and i would say every phone would run differently depending on processors and such, but other then that i am finaly able to do mass updates like the 80gb call of duty updates and stuff that are on that much larger scale. Chears vodafone for bringing us a great deal!",4
Cheats.,"These people send you bills which have been already paid and ask you to pay for something that you havent used at all. Plus they deduct $5 frequently, when enquired why is it so, they have no clue about it.",1
Pay for a service but they canâ€™t provide it,"Customer service is great but the reception is terrible itâ€™s costing me work cause people canâ€™t get through or I canâ€™t ring.Iâ€™ve told them about it but they tell me reception is fine in my area, also canâ€™t use the internet unless your at a certain window. Canâ€™t wait till my contract is over so I can use my phone again.",1
Worst coverage pay for Internet credit i can't  use cause of it terrible service,Will be swapping providers vodafone is bad now i pay good money for Internet credit that half the time i can't  use then when you ring up to get some help they throw on the phone to some one whose English is as good as a 2 year old and only knows there set lines and try blaming there poor coverage on my phone if i could i give no stars and don't  recommend them to anyone,1
Worst customer service I've ever had,The company should not exist. As soon as you want to swap or get out they treat you like crap and won't even let you access your account to cancel it or obtain information. I will shred voda on every corner because they are terrible. I would never ever get them even if they gave me free mobile phone plans that's how crap they are.,1
Dreadful Telco. No customer service. No internet access.,Extremely unreliable. No network coverage since the beginning of February. Not good value for money. Absolutely no customer service. Worst Telco provider ever.,1
Hard work to deal with them...,"At first, the support representative didn't want to cancel a unused service.  I was no longer in contract, it should have been easy.I needed to ring back again to cancel an invoice for a service I no longer had.  It's good thing I kept all my account and private code details.  I remained calm and they cancelled the invoice.

Let's see if my account is really cancelled this time.  I guess time will tell.

It really ought not to be this difficult - this sort of thing should be achievable through their web portal, but one gets the impression they are desperate to hold onto as many customers as possible.

Not good.",2
No Problems Here,I live in a black spot and the only company that gives me a decent reception is Vodafone. It still doesn't all me to use the net but at least I have a reliable service if the land line goes down. The only other problem I have is trying to understand the consultants when I have to ring. I have learnt that you need to make sure you are ask all the important questions before you sign up.,4
Stay away from vodafone,"I was on $80 plan for 2 years and stayed bit longer for 300min international call was included.However vodafone always sended me bill minmum $100 to $350 for almost 3years  on monthly basis.My last bill was $190 and I told them that I wanted end using service. After 1 week I received another $180 bill that I need to pay. When I contact customer care* (which in overseas), He simply told me that was computer generated error.Know I'm left thinking how many ""computer generated error"" that I have been robbed?I wish if there is something out there to track on telephone companies?",1
"Appaling customer service, they don't deserve any stars","I was new in Australia and didn't know which service provider to go with, and randomly chose Vodafone. By far the worst decision I've ever made. Their customer service is appaling, they do not take responsibility for their actions, and when one of their floor staff makes a mistake, they pin the responsibility on the customer. Appaling. I have since swapped my service provider.",1
Worst Coverage: Stinging Exit Fees,"Postpaid plan. Great value - $57 monthly including up to 15Gb... but we travelled from Brisbane to Tassie (via Coast road) & back (via inland Hume Highway) and it didnâ€™t matter which stretch of Highway, town or locality we went thru or stopped at, my mates Optus coverage was always at least 1 bar better, mostly 2 bars better and all too often they had some coverage while I had none... I reluctantly went back to Optus (Amaysim) for about the same price but my call quality and download speeds have improved dramatically. Then, after 8 months with Voda I got stung with $202 exit fee!",2
Great prices and features,Been with Vodafone for 10 or so years. Have had no issues with them service wise or coverage wise. Towards the end of each contract Vodafone have waived last few months and upgraded my phone and plan.,5
Vodafone Provide the WORST Service Possible,"Vodafone is the worst phone provider in Australia.  They present their customers with problems and bad coverage and then when you try to sort out the problems you spend hours on the phone to India!  Do not go with Vodafone ever.  I would suggest you go with Telstra, Aldi, Optusnet anyone.  Just NOT Vodafone",1
21 years of service - brilliant,"Iâ€™ve been a post paid customer for over twenty years now and canâ€™t fault the service - while the coverage in rural areas isnâ€™t as great as Telstra their international roaming service more than makes up for it. I travel regularly with work and cannot fault their service, and with the added advantage to being to access my data and unlimited calls overseas it really makes their product stand out. Competitive pricing with great service.",5
Worst service,"They keep charging me for the data which I have never used, and when I called them about this, they keep transferring calls to the other departments. Don't go with Vodafone, its the worst service provider with rude customer service people.",1
Vodafone is terrible,The network coverage is fairly good but they kept making mistakes on my bills. I was getting charged for data I was not using. Even when I cancelled my contract they kept sending me outstanding bills to my email address that wasn't mine. I rang them about this and kept getting transferred to different people. They could not explain to me why and kept telling me they can't verify me and told me to go to a vodafone store. As if I don't  have anything better to do.,1
Incompetent customer service staff,Vodafone customer service staff are extremely incompetent. I cancelled my contract with them under their 30 day network guarantee due to poor service at my house.  Twice I was told on two separate calls that I would be refunded the bill I paid by a store even though I disputed it as why would Vodafone franchise refund my money.  Was promised call backs by customer service and their complaints departments which never happened. Even had a supervisor tell me to go to my bank and do a bill reverse instead of Vodafone refunding the money I was owedMost incompetent company I have ever dealt with. Would never recommend them to anyone.,1
Do not go with Vodafone,There coverage is so bad between my home and work place and I can't get a call in between . When I called for them they said cos I have coverage at home I should get call from home (seriously..I want a mobile phone not a land phone) after had so much trouble I break the contract and I had to pay around $600 and I called them to make a payment plan and they agreed on that and I made the first payment last week and this week they take out all the rest of the money without noticing me.So annoyed...Their customer service is so bad too.I never recommend Vodafone to anybody. At the moment I take off 5 people from Vodafone and I Will keep doing it.,1
Great phone so easy to use!,Great coverage every where I goPostpaidMy plan is well worth the moneyVodafone have great customer service very helpful.,5
Appalling customer service and patchy coverage at best,"My biggest complaint about this telecommunications company is over their mountains of excess charges. This has happened consistently with the most recent being a $5 daily fee for less than 0.3MB of overseas ""background data"" despite my wireless signal being strong, all apps closed, and the phone remaining stationary. I called them to discuss this and the representative could not have cared less and certainly wouldn't admit to 10 days worth of $5 charges for 0.23MB unreasonable. changing my plan as I wasn't using even 50% of data/talk credit I was paying for in a SIM only plan. Somehow the person who assists with that was never available in store or over the phone. Right. When I finally cancelled my service I was told that I wasn't going to be charged any early exit fees... Standard with a SIM only month-to-month, but thanks so much for not trying to figure out a way to drain my bank account even more than you already have over the past two years. 

Stay far away. All they are about is getting their hands on your money, and the mobile coverage is poor at best. Good riddance to you, Vodafone money-grubbers.",1
recommend everyone not to get vodafone.,Network coverage is worse. With no international call in many countries they ask to buy extra pack for it. Plan is no value for money. Customer service is a rip-off as i called recently i was asking for a new plan guy gave me 10%student discount and20gb extra data JUST FOR ME ONLY one time only offer on 80$ plan and asked me to accept it straight away or no offer but i checked online its nothing special but offer to all till march 3 I think. Trying to lure customer with false information I definitely am not happy. Been in 3 plan since 2009 then vodafone now i will cancel the contract and find new providor,1
It sucks and tricks people,I am going closure to contract and surprisingly i cant make call to my country as it is not listed on the list of countries and everytime i call my country they don't hear first if connection is made first of all and they don't hear me at all so have to make numerous calls and it doesn't get connected to other service providers at all.I have been with them for last 10 years and lie many of my friends i should be quitting them soon.,1
Watch out for Hidden Charges,Wont ever recommend to anyone. Stay away from Vodafone. So many hidden charges and tactics to screw customers over.  Feel sorry for the customer service guys on the Phone from India who have no power to actually do anything.,1
Stay away from Vodafone,I suggest everyone stay clear of Vodafone they are not worth it there call centre is a joke they are still Vodafail they need to clean up there act,1
They Donâ€™t Even Deserve A Star,"Rung up 1 hour after my order was placed to cancel, the lady said that was fine and she would cancel it. 5 days later I receive the phone, rang them up again and asked them whatâ€™s going on. They said you canâ€™t cancel an order once itâ€™s been placed, so now Iâ€™m left with a $450 bill to get out of my so called contract. JOKE",1
"Great customer service, rubbish service systems!","I changed to Vodafone 6 weeks ago and I have had a number of lengthy contacts with their customer service. Customer services have always been very nice and professional, except from one guy who wasn't listening to me and probably took two minutes to notice I had hung up. The problem is I should not have needed to ring the service - oh they tell you the quickest way to activate a sim is on-line, yeah right! I have have the need to do so 4 times over a space of 3 months and not once did it work. The same problem each time - get to a point and it stops and even if you have an account with them you need to go through all the details again with customer service. I think the quickest time may have been an hour to get it sorted but then it can take up to another 4 hours for it to activated. I like the people at the call centre but I have friends to talk to I don't need to spend time on the phone because Vodafone doesn't have systems sorted. They ask for feedback on the call centre but not on their systems and services. No more time to waste - I'm jumping ship!",1
pricy and patchy coverage,"We just visited Wineglass Bay in Tasmania, and while my brother had service with Aldi mobile, and my Dad with Optus, I had no service at all with my vodaphone plan. I have switched to Aldi Mobile because it's A. cheaper, and B. actually has phone coverage",3
Loyalty discount is a joke!,I got a new iphone 8 with $30.50 loyalty discount in the $60 red plan. Paid my first bill with full price and contacted vodafone almost 1 month ago. I'm about to be billed again and they keep inform that my case is under investigation and nobody is able to solve the problem.Ridiculous customer service!,1
Greensborough voda phone store rudest worst customer service seen in 50 years,Greensborough voda phone store just provided the worst customer service I have seen and I am a Gm of a large company with many stores.How bad is it when a customer who is a friend tells the store person to serve another customer (us) as he was not buying and the person ignores this totally as he had asked us to wait a couple of minutes some 10 minutes before and then ignores us completely and in fact asks the other store person who was serving a buying customer could he serve us but he advised he was still 5 ways from finishing.Times must be too easy for this store,1
If there was option of zero star I would have give that to vodafone,Worse network coverage. Called customer service to complain. They always say there is no network problem in your area. But cant even call or receive phone call.,1
Terrible customer service,"I have been with other provider and just changed to Vodafone after we changed our house and the other provider did not have good coverage on my area. In Vodafone shop, when I asked how long will take for my new SIM to get activated, I was told it will take 10 minutes. It has been 3 days and I still cannot make any call and I am sure my SIM card will not get activated any time soon as they always say the same thing and do nothing. First day I spent more than 2 hours in Vodafone shop waiting for my SIM to get activated. First they told me it will take 10 min, then 30 minutes and then they told my sorry something went wrong while your SIM was getting activated and it will be activated with in 4 hours. After 4 hours I went back to the shop and this time after spending a lot of time waiting they told me it will definitely get activated in 24 hours. I was told I cannot cancel my new SIM as it will cause more problem. After 24 hours I called the support and they said you need to wait another 24 hours since we had an outage and your SIM could not get activated. It has been 3 days I am calling them after 24 hours and wait around 40 minutes on the phone for someone to check the activation situation and always I get the same answer which is Sorry we had an outage and we could not activate you SIM and it will be activated within 4 to 24 hours.

I made a big mistake to go with Vodafone. Definitely I will change to other provider.",1
woeful service!,"We are a mobile phone store operator, tried to help a prepaid vodafone client who is 80 years old  who has not been able to simply replace a sim card or use the service for 2 months,They have no customer service facilities at all, fully automated online backlooping service,which follow through if you mange to get them on the phone,  you are required to have a pin code,.. lost it,forget it.. your screwed,they will not assist or verify you..the worst attitude of a telecom service provider i have ever seen..DO NOT USE THEM period!..",1
Downright hostility towards the customer!,"Staff in the Pitt Street Mall store in Sydney can't even seem to summon a smile or welcome customers.  Very little initiative bordering on hostility.  As someone involved in the retail education and training sector, I'd say these Vodafone employees are very poor ambassadors for the brand.  Not an experience I'd want to repeat.  I finally coaxed them into identifying and fixing my problem. The chain is only ever as strong as the weakest link.  All the expensive advertising in the world won't reverse the negative effects of indifferent and sloppy service.",1
Worst and most unreliable company on planet earth,"I am close to loosing my job thanks to Vodafone. It takes up to 21 hours to receive a voicemail notification. I have missed out on thousands of dollars worth of work thanks to their pathetic, slow, useless computer systems.  I will tell you my story. I went into the Vodafone shop and asked to buy a prepaid phone, I was told they no longer do them just a month to month contract. That was their first lie, they still do prepaid. Anyway, I was told I can cancel anytime as it was month to month. Later when I tried to cancel they said I was locked into a 1 year contract. Then the first 4 monthly bills were incorrect. I was being charged for services I didn't sign up for. I got the usual apologies and told it was a 'technical problem'. I was told this for 4 consecutive months. I wanted to cancel but told I could not as I was locked into a contract. Then I started missing out on work as people would call me when my phone was busy or I was busy and I did not receive any notification of voicemail until the next day. The first time it took 9 hours to be informed I had voicemail, the following time it was 7 hours and yesterday I got a very important message from my manager at 5:30pm but did not receive it until 2:10pm today some 21 hours later. This is the third time my manager has called me and I did not respond, now I face possible unemployment thanks to Vodafone.  The first time I was told it was a technical problem and was reassured it was reported and then told the problem was fixed. The second time I was told to go to the Vodafone shop and get a new simple card, which I did. The third time, after nearly losing my job, I demanded financial compensation and was told 'that's not possible'. I stated they can't charge for a service they don't provide but was fobbed off with nonsensical excuses and the usual 'it's a technical problem and will be resolved'. I made the big mistake of buying  a Note 8 for $1600 which is locked to Vodafone, my biggest regret!!!!!!!! So now I can't switch networks. What I would suggest to anyone who relies on a fast, reliable service is to go with another company. As I said I nearly lost my job because of Vodafone's very poor service and numerous technical problems. I have had to resort to buying another  cheap Telstra mobile which actually informs me of voicemail straight away. I now  have to carry 2 mobile phones from 2 different providers thanks to the disastrous 3rd world service which Vodafone provides. Also, they outsource their call centres to a foreign country, they speak broken English and don't have a clue what you are talking about and do not care.  They hang up on you if you get frustrated. I have a $1600 Note 8 which is only good for watching YouTube on and a $50 Telstra phone for making calls, receiving texts and voicemail. If you go with Vodafone after reading these reviews then you are a fool and you will regret it. They lie to their customers, they have numerous technical problems, they have a very poor customer service and their bills are always wrong. Vodafone has to be the worst company I have ever dealt with. Not just bad but shockingly bad and they will not offer you 1 cent in compensation for all the stress they give you. Do not rely on this company. Do not trust this company. Do not give these 3rd rate cowboy charlatans you're hard earned money, you will regret it!!! If I had to some sum up my experience in a few words? An UTTERLY PATHETIC UNRELIABLE  RIP-OFF!!!!!!!!",1
I wish I could give 0 stars.,I wish I could give 0 stars.I had a mobile line which I'd called to cancel.,1
Laughable.. so much hate,"Ran away from Optus, ended up here and they're just as terrible. The Vodafone app (one of their main revenue streams) barely ever works. 90% of the customer reps are untrained, abrasive and unhelpful. I've just switched to Moose Mobile, sick of pouring money into these huge companies that don't bother improving product or customer experience but rather channel all their resources into increasing revenue.",1
Bad phone. No service. No help.,"You sold me a lemon and you are no help in fixing the problems. The store doesn't answer their phone, and your 1555 people are no help. I'm all done with Vodafone, and l'll do my best to influence others about your horrible service.",1
Blatant Lies,"I realised this morning that I was receiving all these text messages saying that I had missed a call. However, my phone hasn't rung at all. After 4 text messages, I decided to call Vodafone and was told that I had added a thing called ""Call Catcher"", where all of my calls are rejected and I receive a message saying I missed a call. Apparently I did this in my sleep!",1
"Trust issues from my experience with other telco's, thank GOD for Vodafone and their transparency.","Warning - long review ahead just because I'm so passionate about honest and reliable companies and Vodafone deserves some recognition for their great services! I'm turning 24 this year and I've been with Vodafone going on 3 years this year. At first I was hesitant to join, especially because I was going to be paying off my phone on a plan (scary stuff when you're only use to buying prepaid credit) but I am a heavily budget conscience/skeptical of sneaky money hungry sales people type of person when it comes to dealing with telco companies and I've had nothing but an exceptionally AMAZING experience with Vodafone. Regardless of the bad reviews below, it might be discouraging to see so many, majority rules right? Wrong. Do your own research, go on Vodafones website and see for yourself. Their sim plans, phone + sim plans, prepaid offers, etc.. are better than most out there. They called me when my phone was a few months away from being payed off to offer me another deal, some people get annoyed with Vodafone calling but I'm up for all them deals and my partner needed a new phone! The best thing was that I was able to get that new phone for my partner, use the iPhone 6s Plus I had paid off with Vodafone and ended up getting an even better data deal for my own phone, whilst my partner put his own sim into the new phone purchased on a monthly pay off deal through Vodafone. I was literally just able to switch my data deal around an hour ago (1:00am) to get some quantas points and even MORE data chucked in the mix. Yes I'm a data hog. Really though, that's one of the awesome things about this company, you will always be able to call the customer service centre if you have any questions or need some help 24/7 and if the team you're trying to reach operates between certain hours, they're able to give you a call back which has come in handy throughout the years. Big ups to Vodafone for changing the game.",5
"Trust issues from my experience with other telco's, thank GOD for Vodafone and their transparency.","Pt 2 - Long and hopefully helpful update ahead. Bad news first. So I had to go into an actual Vodafone store to get some help with my account in person and mind you, because I always have a great time talking to the overseas Vodafone workers (yes they have all been great, you just gotta be patient and explain things in depth at times so there's little room for mistakes to be made), I just assumed the help from the store would be just as good but no. Now I can understand where some of these bad reviews come into place. The inconsistent customer service is annoying and discouraging but as I said in my review, the deals speak for themselves. I probably meet 1 random rude person every few days and unfortunately some rudies have snuck into some Vodafone stores. I just wanted to quickly say that my coverage is great because I'm based in a Metro-ish area and I use the 4G network if that is helpful to anyone. Ok so good news now. I ended up not actually being eligible for the quantas points because they weren't part of my original contract which I was upset about at first, yes this was a mistake from the Vodafone worker for not knowing that he couldn't process my request but it was quickly resolved by another Vodafone worker and the best part is.. I'm sitting at 40GB a month for $60.. works out to be $15 a week for alllll that data and unlimited calls (not international) unlimited SMS and a few other cool things. When I compare my current plan to a previous telco that I had a prepaid deal with before I changed to Vodafone, they don't even stand next to each other. Even though it's been a few years since I've been with the previous telco, their deals haven't changed much so I never regret switching. I will break down my previous deal for whoever is still reading and is interested in knowing the difference

PREVIOUS TELCO* ",5
Best Supermarket Package Deal!,"If you can pick up the Nokia 3, locked into Vodafone as I did for just over $100, on a weekly special at a S/mkt (3 weeks prior to Xmas 2017), or even an extra $50 at the opposition 3 wks later - you'll be doing very well on not just price, but also for the following reasons. First and foremost, unlike other Telcos, Vodafone provide you with 9GB of Data, plus just by Sms-ing them, a further 3.5 GB. Xmas saw a further 3 GB similarly given away, & W/E GB top-ups of 4GB go for $10.  Also, Vodafone's customer service is of a very professional & helpful nature - glad to be back with them (after 5 years). And, their CEO, is a regular guest on the radio station ""Talking -Lifestyle""- so you can keep up with all the current promotions they have to offer - and they're very competitive!
The phone itself, (if you hate the idea of paying $1000 or even $500 for Just a phone,- like me[!], and usually don't wish to pay anymore than $50 for a functional phone), is essentially of an Apple or Samsung class, or at least an HTC!!
Two of the most important things when buying a mobile phone, are Battery Power & basic Internal Data Storage. The more of each, the better you can expect your phone to continue working.
This phone, the lowest of the new revamped Nokia range, surpasses my last Huawei Y560 by 600 mAh, and with 16GB internal storage, that's about twice previous Microsoft, old Nokias, & Telstra generic $50 phones, also purchased from S/mkts! (Although, that said, it's still only Â½ the basic storage, that comes with an Apple.)
Previous phones mentioned were only 3G speed. This is 4G, and inspite of a better battery compassity, still chews through the power quite fast, due to the faster running speed.
None of the Battery or Data Storage is listed on the box. As are not, my final two favourite features. This phone has an Aluminium Frame. It feels firm, sturdy, and solid, unlike the others mentioned, only made of plastic! Last but not least, is that it comes ""Gorilla 3"" Corning Glass; super tough!  These last two features make you feel like you've bought your mobile from Bunnings, instead of Toys R Us !!
This, alongside the Telco Carrier supporting it, is a 'Class' Phone-package! And for what? 10% of what the big brand names demand for their products! This is on a prepaid, monthly recharge basis, locked into Vodafone. 
Sure, if you had another $900 'to burn', you could get an unlocked phone and choose your own Carrier, but to my knowledge, there's only a few others (just one -?) currently offering the same recharge Data amounts for $5 cheaper than the $40 & $50 Vodafone r/c; - whilst not offering a $60 r/c, which Vodafone is currently offering, giving all told, - a whopping 18.5 GB!
So, for a S/mkt-sold, Locked-in Carrier, package deal (and some 25+, $50 mobiles phones later!!), 
I feel this most definitely deserves 9/10 .... and a Koala Stamp",4
I wish i could select no Star. Couldn't get connection in shopping centre and Dockland VIC,"I wish i could select no Star. Couldn't get connection in shopping center and Dockland VIC.If you like cheap option, then go for it, but remember those ""extra data"" you may not be able to use at all!!",1
Plans suck sheep,"Honestly? You don't seem to have a single plan that has loads of data instead you have a million plans with unlimited calls. I don't call anyone. And I know many other people who don't call anyone. Unfortunately I've inherited this dumb plan from another dumb family member. Why the hell don't you have something like unlimited data with limited calls?? Oh I know, so you can add your little extra 10 dollar bill, or so we can buy data packs!!

"Ups and downs, but mainly quite good","I have been with Vodafone for about 4 years now. And in general, everything has been ok.- My network coverage has been very good. Very few places I have had poor network coverage.- I'm on a 12 month contract. $36 for 10GB and Unlimited texts/calls.- My plan is decent value for money. But phone plans are becoming more data heavy in general.- The customer service has been ok, but they call me too often to try and get me to upgrade plans or upgrade my phone. Even after I requested they didn't.- I travelled China for 1 month and used the $5 per day roaming. It worked great. Very happy with this.",3
Fantastic,Switched to Vodafone after bad customer service with another phone company. That was 3 months ago. I have never had any trouble with reception or slow internet. My plan on Vodafone offers the same as my old plan but is $20 less per month. Could not be happier with this service.,5
Great,Network coverage is very reliable. Postpaid contract and excellent value for money. Extremely satisfied with everything. Love love this product.,5
Misguiding and wrong information,They not deserve even 1 star. I used more then 5 years this network but customer service peopleâ€™s always misguiding and give wrong information.,1
0 start worst service.,"They are no help when you need them they give out fasle information. Some of the staff say one thing  and others say another. Ive being paying  for insurance  for a while  and i wish i saved that money instead  bcos  then i could buy a whole new phone now. They tell me to send my broken phone over east for repair. When i go in stores they tell me to call vodafone  to lodge an insurance claim.  Why the ***** cant they just repair  it and give me a replacement  phone in perth instead of sending it over east??? Its just time i dont have. I go in circles  with them. The only time vodafone are present  and trying  to do as much  as possible  is when there trying  to take your money. I'll  never waste my time with them again. 
Also did i metion when you call them none of them are ozzie.",1
Worst EVER Not worth a Star at all,"Vodaphone advertise Fast Internet, great coverage and good service. Sorry Vodaphone you get Zero out of three.After seeing the now obvious lies on TV I checked out the coverage map and found I had full coverage. I then unknowingly wasted $40.00 on a Sim Card only to find full Bars on Vodaphone means NOTHING. I rang the Help line to be told their Fast Internet was limited to 2Mbs. On a 300Mbs 4G capable service this is outrageous. If their service is so seriously crippled to start with why even advertise it in the first place. In any case Vodaphone has taken Communications in Australia Back twenty Years. Seriously STAY AWAY from Vodaphone! The two other Carriers in my area supply more than TEN TIMES the speed on ONE BAR than Vodaphone supply's on 4 Bars, WTH?",1
absolute scam,when i first started they said i would get 18gb on my phone then when i went ahead with plan i got only 16gb then on top of that some months i dont go over the 16gb on $75 monthly plan i get charge $90.30 there always looking for ways to rob you and when you call them and explain they just go mmhmmm yes sir mhhhmmmm yes i understand mmmhmm mhhhmm morons and thieves at the same time would not recommend at all,1
How can this company still exist?!,Continual drop outs! Sms that NEVER make it to the recipient! Internet that is slower than old fashioned dial up! Shame on you vodafone! You are the worst!,1
The worst - do not use,"If I could give this half a star I would. Worst mobile service ever - hated dealing with them and getting a headache with my bills each month. The staff in the call centre were rude and unhelpful, especially when I closed my account after 10 years of using their service.",1

All sucks network and take money,What shame on the Vodafone company they took money without notification and send me the billGarbage customer service and never recommend anyone in future,1
Goodness me,"Signed up to a plan offering 6Gb of data. Activated it and only got 5Gb. Called up and spent an hour on the phone, but they didn't resolve the issue. Called up again, another hour on the phone. They told me that I had made a mistake on sign-up. I disagreed as I just answered a series of sign-up questions which I answered as I thought would get me the 6Gb i.e. the data plan. They told me to go back to the store and get another sim card and re-activate. This all took place over a number of weeks, by which point in time I couldn't remember my password. The manager at the store would not help me retrieve or reset my password. I had moved interstate and had changed my license, and the manager said I had to bring in my original license which I had to forfeit when I changed license. He said there was nothing he could do for me and that was my only option. He said ""That's Vodafone policy"". I asked if it would help if I brought in my passport. Suddenly Vodafone policy changed and my passport would be ok.
I complained to the call centre and had the issue escalated. After a number of phone calls Vodafone offered to give me the 6Gb of data I had originally purchased. The catch was that I had to go back to the store and get a 3rd SIM card! I told them to mail me a new SIM card, but they refused. 4 hours on the phone, months down the track, just to get what I paid for in the shop and they were still asking me to go out of my way to get another SIM card. No way! I don't think @vodafoneau consider how much customer time they waste.",1
apple watch and vodafone,I purchased an Apple Watch 5 weeks ago and it does not sync with my iphone.  I have spent so much time on the phone with Vodafone... sync... unpair ... repair... they ask me the same questions every single time I speak with them.  They blame the watch yet I took the watch to Apple and they advised their network has issues.  Seriously !!!  I really am over it !!!  Have been a customer for over 10 years and now it is time to cancel services and find another carrier... Vodafone you have failed ... VodafailThe endless calls with Vodafail have drived me absolutely nuts ... they seriously have no idea ... I am going to cancel my 10 year relationship with Vodafail ... worst service I have ever received.,1
Mobile phone plans,A rep from vidaphone called me to discuss my current plan. When I told her how much I was paying per month she was able to save me $10 per month and still keep my current benefits. I also was able to change my sons plan to the same saving him $10 a month too.,5
Absolutely f+Ã—Ã·==king hopless,Network is crap can't get the internet most of the time unless i go outside. can't even take phone calls inside sometimes. Have to roam back yard sometime for a signal. Was told that i would nit be on a contract as i had my own handset but i find out I'm on a 12 month plan. Once I'm off this crap network I will never come back.,1
Great Customer Service!,My husband and I attended the Vodafone store located on level 1 at Fountain Gate Shopping Centre. Steve was the store attendant who helped us.,5
Best customer service.,I have had the best customer service ever. Ubed was so great so helpful in selling me a new phone and plan. Thanks so much Ubed.,5
No copy of contract,I didn't receive a copy of my contract when I purchased phone in store. I was promised a discount because the phone was out of stock. The discount was not on the contract and I was told that I just had to trust them. Not good business practices.,1
rubbish service,I was a vodafone customer for 4 months and it is absolute rubbish service provider. I work in the heart of Melbourne CBD and i keep getting dropped out . Vodafone says that we only give coverage to your residential address and cannot assure 100% coverage to your work address... what a joke. You call their customer service and they will keep you on hold for at least 30 minutes. will offer you all sorts of discounts to stay back..I switched to virgin and they charged me 127 AUD for breaking the contract...i have raised this issue with TIO ...,1
terrible customer service and website,"I have to pay my phone bill monthly, every time I pay by my card, it pops up with technique issue, the payment never success even I use various browsers or network. I go to the store ask the staff, she resists that it all my problem because she successfully pay the bill in their store, and she said if I had a problem of online payment, then I have to come to their store every month to pay the bill or use Bpay or lock, I ask for her if she can tell their technical team to address this problem, she told me to call them because I am only the customer who had this issue. The way she performs really disgusting when she helped me to do the payment, she said give me the card!, I want to type my card number by my self, she ignores me. when she returns the card back to me, she put on the table, and said, take off the card. No thank you, no apologies, not understanding my situation, the root of the problem not yet been solved.  
The good company needs respectful staff, please.",1
Very disappointed...,"I have been a Vodafone customer for many years and overall haven't had many issues. The normal frustration with average coverage has come up occasionally however the competitive deals were the trade off.The new Vodafone however just gets worse with each interaction. I had received a call from the ""sales"" telling me to provide personal details immediately as there was an issue with my service. I declined this invasive offer and rang customer service to find out what the issue was. No issue just an underhanded attempt to get the foot in the door. 
I made a formal complaint 5 months ago and still never received the elusive call back that I was promised to resolve the issue.
This has passed now and I had gotten over it, I must be on the do not call list. 
In recent months my bill began jumping significantly due to automatic data blocks. Now the jumps are 50% of my normal bill charged on top. 
I checked out the new plans to see what options there are to learn my plan is 2 months off expiry and terrible value. $79 for 6gb.
Vodafone acknowledged my concern and offered a red hot deal of $89 for 6gb.... 
So I am confused, I let them know it's pretty poor so they offer $100 for 10gb....
The new customer plans offer $60 for 40gb.
I called to see what they can do as currently I'm insulted as a consumer.

"Poor coverage, plan","I was with Vodafone for more than 2 years. At that time I was in a 24-month phone plan, which was about $50 a month, and they deposited directly from my bank account.The network was disappoiting. I lived in a populated area in Sydney. My location was supposed to be covered, but my phone could always receive no signal when I was in my home! I asked some friends, and found I was not the individual case - all the Vodafone users complained such issues!Also, they will never let you that your phone plan was going to expired. If it did expire, they would still charge you the amount as you were in a phone plan, until someday you realise and ask them to stop that.
After some months my phone plan was expired, I switched to Telstra. Goodbye Vodafone, never ever think about getting me back again.",2
terrible service,"I ordered an iPhone X in November and received in December.Later I changed my mind and called Vodafoe before it was despatched to cancel the order but they told that they could only cancel once the handset is received. waiting for a month to receive the handset for a month.once I received the handset  I went to the store where  I signed the contract and they refused to take the handset back and asked me to call the customer service, which I did and they advised me to return the handset to the store. working full time and having small kids , struggled to go to the store the second time where they just ignored me and asked me to contact the customer service and they will send the satchel for returns.i got so frustrated because it was the third time and when they got me to sign the contract they told that the return is EASY and no questions asked. For the fourth time I contacted the customer service and they send me a. return satchel. I managed to send the handset ( which was not even opened),to the centre and they received the handset on 21st December .later in first week of January I received a email stating that the direct debit service will be commencing on 8/1/18.I called the customer service to notify that the handset is been returned and I want to cancel the contract and not to go ahead with direct debit.later few days they have done the direct debit and I have called the customer service after having to wait good long minutes.I am still waiting for them to sort this out.its ridiculous and in first place they should have been able to cancel the order before even it got despatched.i would never ever think about going with Vodafone.its just waste of time .",1
The poorest customer service ever. I would not employ your team,"I am an overseas visitor and needed to top up a phone card for my time here. I had to experience an exchange of a phone card twice that would not activate to be told by the field team to go to a branch to get sorted and expected this to be a simple process. I am exasperated at the lack of care and customer service experienced today at Brandon Park Shopping Centre with Sumit. He approached the counter eating, he was slovenly in attitude and told us to go back to where we had purchased the card after us explaining the situation. Myself and my sister were there for an hour and 30 minutes and observed his uncaring unprofessional dismissive and arrogant manner. He reluctantly called your field team and was on the phone for some time but did not update us. He spoke to them in his mother tongue which we considered rude. Feedback needs to be given as he has today damaged your reputation.  To protect your brand you need to employ staff who are customer focused. I employ colleagues in the customer sector and would not employ a person with such attitude and am disappointed you feel this acceptable .",1
$40 SIM card package that didn't activate and you need to wait 24 hours to get resolved.,I perchased a $40 12.5GB SIM card for my phone to use while I'm back home in Sydney for two months and I went through the process of activating it and gave all my details and drivers lisence number and it didn't activate. I waited a day thinking it would and nothing happened I contacted them today and they said it was an issue from there side. And was told I needed to wait 24hours for the issue to be solved. I didn't buy the card to have to wait to use it. I needed it straight away! If I knew it would be such an issue I would have gone to a different company. And I bought the same card at the time for my parent. Such an annoying start to my trip.,2
Misleading,I was offered a deal on a plan during chat online with Vodafone customer service.Promised best deal and was asked to pick up the phone from vodafone outlet.On arrival i was offered completely different phone.Though i down loaded the transcript still they didnot honour what sales agent offered.No wonder vodafone has 1000s of complain to ombudsman,1
"The worst experience with a phone company, very unprofessional!","Despite their ads, their service is not satisfactory and there are many areas they don't have coverage. If you complain about their service, instead of helping you they get angry and abusive on the phone and in one case they threat me of legal action because I was complaining about their service.Since I changed my plan I realised I could have used my phone in many places that I thought it was impossible to have minimum reception. Anyway, I don't know how these companies are allowed to operate in Australia! Their rating for their service and customer relation is ZERO in my opinion, they have a long way to go to be a modern 21st-century company!!!",1
It provides what you need,Network coverage become zero when you travel further up or down from Melbourne.My plan contains international calls where Sri Lanka is not listed. So pretty much it is waste but it contains more data.Recently they have removed me from their existing plan and deliberately switched me to new plan. That was really bad.,3
The absolute worst,"If there is even a slight breeze outside, or one cloud in the sky - forget having signal. I have complained so many times and was assured that if I upgraded my modem and signed a new contract, that my woes would be a thing of the past. What an idiot I was to believe that!  I have just called to cancel and have been told to call back tomorrow as the business team are not there. Vodafone = VodaFAIL",1
Vodafone screwed people donâ€™t trust them,"There customers service people donâ€™t talk politely and they charge wrong. Get lost vodaphone .Hi guys I m Vodafone customers and I had $85 plan for 24 months .i already done 23 month and last month of my contract Vodafone care called my to upgrade my plan ,I said ok I m happy to upgrade and they said your plan going to finish after one month so u can upgrade now so your service not going to suspend,And they charge $85 for last month payment even I used only 5 days and they also charge $65 dollars for my new plan which was $40 plan each month.
I called back to customer care about discuss this issue they said our agent did right job we cannot do anything.i m unable to do anything because I signed up my new contract but no more Vodafone anyway.
So please Vodafone customers if u going to finish your contract be careful to sign up new contract they give you wrong information and if you complain thy do nothing.",1

The worst service..people and products,"Had a prepaid internet with this lot. Couldn't get coverage 60% of the time. Hours on the phone trying to get it solved....tech team even told me see I've was useless.So after 3 months of fighting with them about it....closed my account. Got rd by the foreign woman I felt with, my account would be cleared and any payments due cancelled.6 months later I get a debt collector looking for payments.And not 1 e-mail, call or letter from Vodafone......great way to keep customers happy.When contacted about this....they just said ""Yes it's all noted about the problems, and solutions....but as far as they where concerned......account was still to be paid "" And there had been no service to that internet for 6months.....they disconnected it after my last call about problems. 
So don't and cant supply a service, but I'm still having to pay for it......my business will not ever use Vodafone again.",1
Horrible customer support and organization,"I had been with Vodafone for four years and will switch. They've just brought anxiety to me. I've requested to change the account ownership 6 months ago which they did after a very painful process. Their customer support team is useless. Yet, they've been harassing the previous owner for one month EVERY DAY and sending me threatening letters about an outstanding bill. When I call them to understand what was going on and to tell them to stop calling my friend who was getting very angry with being harassed, they could not give me any reasons and kept talking about random protocols. And this was on the phone with a supervisor, so you can only imagine the quality throughout the customer support team. 

Horrible customer service, would definitely stay away.",1
Worst company go to Telstra,Network coverage bad.Service poor and tell constant lies.Poor company.Won't ever deal with them again.Tell you one thing and don't deliver.Offer old phones as upgrades or phones they don't have in stock.,1
You get a different story from every employee!,"Vodafone makes the simplest jobs ten times harder. They send you on a wild goose chase of store visits, phone calls and emails to get simple issues dealt with. No two departments have the same story, and there seems to be terrible miscommunication between head office and the stores. While there are some wonderful employees who will try their best to help you, they have usually not been informed of policy changes or been given the correct information to actually get you what you need. Don't even bother, it's not worth the headache.",1
Bad reception or completely nothing.,Very bad reception for 3 days now. In Double Bay the reception is worst. Canâ€™t receive or call. Should have inform us if thereâ€™s any issue.,1
Worst Phone Bluetooth dud,"I purchased a Sony Xperia xa1 Ultra from Vodafone, I am having trouble paring my device with the car Bluetooth and home stereo  Bluetooth. I tool the phone back, explained the issued and the Perth store is the worst as they did not want to assist and said that the issue was with the car and sounded like robots as I kept being told the same thing and that they cannot help. The phone was sent for repair (it was a 7 day that I had the phone) and when it was returned to me, I was told there is no fault with the phone. The Bluetooth still does not pair with the car or any audio device. There is no customer service or support. The only thing that Vodafone is interested in selling you a phone and that is it. All I want is for the Bluetooth to work.",1
Broke promise each and every stage,"hi, I was very upset when I signed contract with Vodafone. I havenâ€™t got what they promised. When I terminated my account, I got surprise with hefty bill. Vodafone is the worst company I have ever felt with.",1
Worst service misleading information stupid manager,"Hi, I got plan and they were not able to fix my phone and told me pay and 900 to cancel plan I told what I have to do with phone they told whatever you want you can do...Even network problem and for bill also every time paying 35 dollar for but last 3 months charging 55 without informing anything....when call them they told we ask .manager they told we inform and not accepting anything rather forcing to pay that.I hope it will help other people.",1
be very careful and know your rights,"a rep called me offering a super special. I could keep my $22 plan , extend for 24 months and get a free tablet with 3 gig of data.. a few times I asked are you sure I would not pay more than $22 to Vodafone per month total.. answer was yes... ok, that appears great.. of course I would do it... no.. it actually meant I would pay $22 for my phone plan and an extra $22 for the 3 gig with a free tablet for 24 months... I became suspicious after a day or 2 and rang Vodafone to cancel after confirming I would have to pay $44 per month total to Vodafone. they wouldn't let me cancel. point blank NO you are stuck with it.... my daughter then went to a store in the shopping centre and told them the story. the lovely lady actually fixed the problem saying that of course I could cancel within 7 days. NO FUSS.. she is the only redeaming feature that allows 2 stars.... so be very careful and know your rights...",2
It's okhay for people who just come and travel in australia to use this provider.,"Sometime the network is lost in certain place and on the train. The price is a bit high and need more improvement on network coverage in suburb. Service in the branch also a bit unsatisfactory for me, because the costumer service is not describe their product. So, i have no knowledge for the option which vodavone will offered to their costumer.",4
Mobile post paid too slow for browsing or anything at all,"I've had some pretty slow data connection with other providers but Vodafone is by far the worst. I recently switched to Telstra as soon as my contract was finished, tested the speed with my wife's phone who was still on Vodafone. I got 58mb/s while her Vodafone service was 1.6mb/s. I had to put up with this for 12 months so I wanted to write this review to help others avoid disappointment from being stuck with them in a new contract. I complained many times to them but they never responded to my complaints. Good way to lose customers Vodafone. It's pointless offering customers all the data allowance on a 4G network when they're never going to be able to use it up at such slow speeds.

To top it off, when I switched to Telstra, I had to pay Vodafone an extra 3 weeks even I stopped using their services. They told me that they bill monthly so I was forced to pay for the rest of the month. Their billing cycle involves paying 2 weeks in advance. I'd thought after the bill came, it would be the last but I missed the cycle or something like that the way they explained. Not sure how the TIO allows them to steal money from their customers like this. This should be illegal and ASIC should really do something about this.",1
"No coverage for 3 days, vodafone does not want to accept it","No service at all. No phone service and no internet coverage. When contacted Vodafone for clarification, they simply refuse that there was any problems. They were explained that 2 accounts had the same problem and both phone sets were restarted numerous times. One phone is Android phone, other is iPhone.even given information about 3 post codes that I traveled to from 3rd November to 5th November but Vodafone insisted on same that there was no issues on their side. After a month of going round and round, they just offered a $10.0 compensation which I gladly refused. Mind you, my family has been with Vodafone for over 5 years. I think they just lost 3 accounts",1
global roaming con,"After looking around I thought I had found the solution to my global roaming issues.  Red 40 plan unfortunately for 12 months, but with the flexibility of using it when I needed to but not when I had adequate wifi.  Wasn't in for a shock.  Halfway through the trip I start getting texts saying I have activated global roaming charges. So far I have made one call is about 60 seconds. Received one for about 15 seconds. Also supposedly used data. 1 kB per day despite having data turned off.  All up about $100 of charges for what was essentially  2 calls.  Six conversations later I have achieved one thing only.  I have managed to be called a liar by 6 different Mumbai call centre staff.  They then tried to close my account without my authorisation and finally offered me a $20 discount bit my next bill which also has excess global roaming fees.  One giant con and you can't dispute them.  Stay away, very away.",1
Very wrost,I finished my Plan on March 2017 and I was been called just once for plan in end after a month.

ShamelessThey did not inform me at the end of month and I paying for 9 months rediculous.,1
My worst nightmare!,"Don't be deceived by the positive reviews, itâ€™s fabricated. Vodafone is a corrupt and money driven network. How does one exhaust 3G in 3 days? Even when youâ€™re on wi fi, your data still gets used by Vodafone. This is the worst thing that ever happened in Australia.",1

Internet access around Adelaide Sydney country NSW,"Amazing enough that the progress of the service over the past 15 years with Vodafone, that bought out my original provider Orange and then 3 network.

I did paid over a thousands dollars for Vodafone because someone has stolen my ID and sign up contra,"I did paid for Vodafone over a thousand dollars for someone stolen my ID to sign up a contact 3 Yearâ€™s ago and Veda has cost me over another thousand of Dollars for the Fee and now im still end up with bad Credit because Vodafone doesnâ€™t Removed my name out of the list , hoe come Veda and Vodafone accept my Money for their Fee and im still in Bad Credit , i did paid for both companies to remove my name out of bad credit but there is not do as what they said. I'm writing this 2nd review to all people in Australia to know that Vodafone and Veda the 2 companyâ€™s has ripped me off totally $4000.00. My ID was stolen by someone 4 years ago, last year i went to the Bank applying for a Loan and the Bank told me I'm in Bad Credit and needs to call Veda to clear it, i did call and they charged me $2000.00 in Fee and then reported that I'm in bad Credit by Vodafone, if i want to clear the bad Credit i need to pay another $2000.00 for Vodafone because my ID was stolen by someone and they signed up the contracts with Vodafone and don't pay the bill . After i paid this 2 company i went back to the Bank and I'm still in bad Credit, i went to Vodafone and told them that i had paid the moneys and why don't clear out my bad credit, so i said the system is controlled by Veda and i need to contact Veda again, i did call Veda and they told me my name was cleared on their system and i have to contact Vodafone to clear it up. This is really a joke or what, remember each time I'm calling Veda was always spoken to many different Indian Staffs and always want me to pay the moneys first. If anyone in bad credit just don't worry, by Law in Australia they have to clear it after 7 years so don't pay any attention to those company like me, thank you for reading this so long.",1

My bills have never been over $90 and now they are $250... not happy. And the customer service is absolutely crap.,1
Telco Horrors,"Vodafone coverage has improved but still needs further investment in South Australia. Customer service is really amateur, wrong advice, and bad information resulting in extra costs. Data management is very poor. Be very careful with your data use. Vodafone provide data usage updates but they are always behind, so you will suffer extra costs if you use their inadequate data management services. You can call up Vodafone to have data turned off, but the customer service officers are often ignorant of this fact. Really hard to get clear helpful support from their below par offshore customer service. Vodafone have improved though. I came back to Vodafone, but I will be leaving again. Some of these issues relate to all Telcos. I can handle some mistakes etc but its really hard to get a customer service officer, even senior ones, who are on the ball and helpful. Have had some good advice, but being told bad or wrong information is difficult to accept.",1
"So awesome,lovely service.Great company","I upgraded today and also got a Samsung tablet thrown in.Best service,there for the customer.Never had a problem with their products or service.",5
Helpful,I choose Vodafone because its value for money and I'm comfortable with the Internet and mobile pre paid. I'm always happy with the service whenever I recharge my devices.,5
Absolutely rubbish,"I have a two year contract and pay $92/month for a phone plan. I live in Melbourne and all the suburbs which I live and work in have full Vodafone network coverage as it says on their website. The problem is, I haven't had more than two signal bars on my phone. I thought it's my mobile set problem which it wasn't because I checked it with at least two more phones. I called them many times and every single time their response was ""we're upgrading our network coverage"" or ""we're installing a new tower"".Now it's about three months since I first called them. I called today and asked to terminate my contract. At first they said they have another upgrade happening tonight. I felt like they're fooling me or it's a joke. When I rejected and asked them to terminate my contract, they said I have to pay early exist fee. When I explained that they have failed to fulfill the terms in the contract, the guy said we have had an investigation before but most run another one again on your case before we discuss the termination option. 
Just trying to buy more time and make more money.

This is absolute fraud in my opinion because their website is showing something and I'm experiencing something else.

Wish Product Review had zero star as well.",1
Never trust carefully check your bill,Several time i get charged more than my actual plan and added charges for calls and data i did not use.I got chocked when i share my experience with few of my mate AND they had overcharged few times and had to call them and credit!!!My advice again never trust and go away of this company.,1

No phone service for over a month!,I cannot believe due to works being done in the area I cannot receive or make phone calls and it will be like this for over a month. How can they expect you to continue with your contract.,1
"Uninspired Cold Call, Old Aggressive Tactics.","Very poor cold call experience from Scott [?]. Said he was originally from TPG, but now owned by Vodafone. Aggressively pushing me to divulge information about the company current service providers, using very old information. I asked for an email [so I could confirm his credentials at least], he kept talking over me, pushing for details in order to move to the sale. When I stated that I was not going to give him any detail as I recognised this as a sales cold call with outdated lead intel he responded with ""I hope if you ever do a marketing or cold call you get rejected"" and then ended the call.

Honestly, had he started with 'I am calling to discuss an opportunity to migrate your services to Vodafone and consolidate your services under a one-stop provider' and not been so aggressive thinking he could push me into divulging info or bully me into a meeting I would have been much more open to the proposal.",1
Security issue: Vodafone mobile with online banking,"There were some security issue with my ANZ online banking or my mobile carrier Vodafone, i logged on my ANZ online account (credit card)  on 8 March, 2021 around 15:00 - 16:00 and changed the log on password , but I did not get a "" confirmation message of change of password"" SMS from ANZ ........not until twenty something hours later.....that was the next day  - 9 March, 2021, the mid day at 12:11, and asked me call 13 33 50 if i did not make this change, what good does this message do now ? I remembered that i changed my detail, my email, my password on 3 February 2021, three separate confirmation SMS were sent to me within 10 seconds as soon as i completed changes online,  may be it was a technical isssue on my mobile carrier ""Vodafone"", or both companies ANZ  and Vodafone have different issuess. I did not want to post this, but I found this issue was quite serious, because this happened in the business hours, and considering the public interest  - everyone now are doing a lot of online transcations either at home or at work.",1
Canâ€™t give 0 star review,"THE worst mobile phone company Iâ€™ve ever been with. Was with Vodafone for 3-4 years. Went in to upgrade my plan and the staff decided to add another number to my account without asking. This in turn has cost me extra each month. When I brought this to the attention of the sales representatives over the phone, they didnâ€™t seem to care. Itâ€™s very very frustrating and hard to explain the situation when nobody speaks English. Harassing phone calls allhours of the day and again mentioned this to staff who didnâ€™t even care. I will be taking this issue up with consumer affairs as Iâ€™ve been forced to pay $404 ona bill that they arenâ€™t willing to deduct this other numbers payments from or even supply me with a bill as proof. I will also be taking up the harassing phone calls with the appropriate sources.

They're thiefs,Vodafone decided to deduct $98.00 from my account even though no bill was outstanding and my monthly bill of $40 had not even been issued and claim they dont even know where my money has gone. I have sent them proof that they had taken the money from my account without consent and they tell me they won't be able to sort it out for at least 10 days.,1
Phone scam,"I don't use their services, but I have been receiving call from them in the last few days, claims that I have an account with Vodafone and need my name to verify the account.  I refuse to tell them my name and hanged up but they keep calling me nearly every day.",1
Vodafone doesn't honor promotions.,"Vodafone has a current offer on it's $30 Prepaid SIM Starter pack. It's 15GB of data normally but due to it's current promotion an additional 25 GB of bonus data is added on top of that to entice new customers to their service. I was one of them! A quick addition shows me, 25 GB + 15 GB is 40 GB. And quite correctly even this is what is stated in the email they sent me. Very good. As expected. This is not what I got, I only recieved 30 GB. So What happened to this missing 40-30 GB = 10 GB of data. Well It turns out unbeknownst to me, there were additional terms and conditions that apply. Terms and conditions that do not appear anywhere mind you as the phone support could not show me. You see this offer ONLY applies to SIM cards activated as phones not as DATA only tablets or broadband dongles or some such; So according to them I activated the SIM card ""wrong"". Nowhere was this stated before hand, they instead say since my specific kind of activation for a SIM card isn't explicitly made clear as the offer applies to the former. Keep in mind the offer and terms both make no reference to this offer only SPECIFICALLY applying to a specific kind of SIM activation (this is technically meaningless too mind you, a SIM card is activated or not). And Vodafone is stubbornly insistent on this excuse as being valid for deceptive and misleading promotion and advertising. If this is how they weasel their way out of honoring promotions that attract customers to them, I have little confidence in doing further business with them. If this is a reflection of how they deal with misunderstandings, disputes and issues customers have I can only expect the same weaselly conduct out of them for the future. For this reason, my only advice and take away for any prospective customers is to stay clear of them and their offers as they suddenly may pull the rug from under you and invent new excuses as to why they cannot honour their promises and promotions. Take this as a cautionary tale. As for me, once my data expires in mid March I will be closing my account with them. Thank you but no thank you, i don't need frustration and bickering over excuses for imaginary terms and conditions not stated anywhere in the offer or it's T & C.",1
Zero care for longstanding customer loyalty,"- I have been a customer with Vodafone for over a decade- I bought a tablet for $20 per month, to use at home for streaming services to my TV on a 24 month contract- The 24 months came and they just continued to charge me, they did not give me an option to end my service- I noticed 10 months later and I asked to be refunded $200 as I never used data or made calls from the device, I was just paying for something I had already paid off- They refused this and offered me $60, which reluctantly accepted- I will move my 2 business accounts and my husband's account now, which is a total value of $197 per month (had they refunded me past my contract end date, I would have gratefully continued as a customer)
- It was very difficult to get an answer from them, it has taken almost a month to come to this disappointing conclusion and they charged me $20 for that month... terrible
- Their procedures are robotic, slow and disappointing
- I will never be back, there are far too many other options for consumers out there- nobody need be tied down to a company like this.",1
Scammers,"If your with vodafone make sure you get a termination letter from them.

Also they dont send bills to your email, so how would you know you owe them money after you disconect because you dont have access to your vodaphone account. All this over $60.",1

Contacted by email in December to make sure it was all documented, it was taking 4-6 days for them to respond, so ended up missing my bill due date, as I didn't get the reminder we were still trying to sort out. Still awaiting the last reply from beginning of February!Turns out Vodafone cut of my sim connection, without warning (again no notifications) and haven't contacted me regarding it. Did this the 8th I found out today (24.2)
Called 9.2, regarding no replies to emails, no notifications and reminders, paying overdue amount, while service advisor seemed very helpful, she failed to see that my account had been cancelled (data account btw, so not used frequently), and set technical support on the case, which I received a text regarding (first notification, in 7-8 months). I tried to log on to pay my bill, no access to my account.
Called Vodafone, 1.15hrs call, transferred 5+times, told lies and fobbed off, in the end I was told the first advisor was completely wrong and wasted half an hour of my time, then told my sim could be reconnected, but only if I signed up to Direct Debits, even though they cannot provide the service they have promised me for months. I could cancel the DD, but why should I feel sneaky or sly, they need to supply a reliable service to me, and a decent customer service network. Not blackmail me with conditions to get what I am paying for.
They also told me what I was sold a year ago, was not actually what I had been getting.
Their customer service is awful, their network is average and the stores I have visited in recent years have been terrible too and gone down hill, in South Australia southern suburbs anyway. I will not be using Vodafone again! 
The whole experience today has caused a worse than normal migraine, and upset my little boy with the time it took and the stress it caused.",1
sold me a lemon,Sorry i never write these types of things but here goes after getting on my plan for a google pixel 3A through vodaphone the first 6 months not a hitch then my phone refuses to charge. Took it up too the vodaphone shop in bondi junction where he sent me to the city george st to be exact..waitied for the guy who was supposed to be a technician who told me the port was broken and it would cost me $500 to fix. I didnt trust the guy and asked them where i could see there policies on warrenties etc etc. Nothing on failures of the charging ports. Next i went to the google official guy in castlereigh st who fixed it for $200 telling me it wasnt anything i had done it was a simple case of wear and tear and not a very good phone..He was very helpful and really tried to help me. Fast forward 5 months and whilst charging my phone it starts vibrating uncontrolably and stop working. Once again i take it to George st where this so called technician tells me without even opening it it will be $800 but maybe i should just buy out my plan for 12 months and upgrade..surely its under warrenty but no the terms he cant show me proof for again say no hardware no ports nothing like that we cover for..take it back to old mate who helped me last time who opens it up and says the motherboard is fried and your phone is dead....now im stuck on a plan with no working phone through no fault of my own...bad products bad customer service bad everything. the guy at the google reair place was the only decent human being in the whole senario..,1
"Misinformation, incompetence and just plain shameful customer service!!!","Made an order approximately 1 and half months ago for a Samsung S20 Note Ultra on the $40 infinite data lite plan through the Vodafone website. Got an email back saying ""order failed"" but didn't say why. So I called to ask and the guy said it's because I wasn't eligible due to not having a credit history with them. He said I needed to be on a plan for 6 months to build up my credit score with them before being eligible for any of the 12, 24, 36 month phone contract plans through them.ling me just the $40 Lite Plan with the bonus offer of $5 off the $40 original price (part of the deal Vodafone was offering for a limited time only to new customers). I gave all my details, including setting up direct debit payments. Received my new sim (no phone because I was on the SIM ONLY plan) and everything was fine so far.

Now this is where the fun starts. Because yesterday I received my first bill of not $35 but $74.99 !!!! Immediately contacted Vodafone customer service expecting it was just an error, but nope! The entire discussion desolved into arguing with me about how I am paying for a phone that I don't have and never ordered! Which by the way would be $47.19 for the phone + $35 for the plan equals $82.19 per month. Not $74.99!? So that's definitely wrong!! 

Next up was arguing with me about why even at $35 I wasn't getting the youth discount (25 and under) 10% off the ruduced $35 price. (Part of the 5 bonus offers that came with the plan). Her incompetence told me the 10% was off the $40. Making it $36 per month with the 10% discount.... Yup....

Next her strategy was to try and tell me you can't have more than 2 offers. Well there's actually 5 bonus offers in total that come with the plan. Others being +40GB of data, bundle and save and 3 months of Amazon Prime and Music Unlimited.

It used to be 'OK' now just appalling. Moving after trying to stay loyal.,"I've been a Vodafone customer for over 10 years. I used to be ok with it on a balance of price vs service. It has unfortunately just slipped too far.I have x4 Business mobile accounts, Business NBN and also personal mobile connections.Its just hit rock bottom. I cannot tell if they've cut back severely on service staff since the newest CEO took over but it is certainly very closely aligned timing wise.Shuffled thru service agents in different departments all giving the same answers regardless of the issue.tting worse not better. Our NBN connection for business has been cutting out at least x10 times a day, particularity in wet weather conditions. It has gone on for 6 months of being given the run around. The much promised 'failover' to 3G/4G of our service if the NBN either doesn't work or the speed is not better than 2mbs. We just cannot run the business with this! Telstra's failover works x10 faster. We've seen it in action now. 
All other neighbours to our location use Telstra or Optus and have minimal issues. When they do have an issue these companies have had service people there inside 24H. I've been wasting time with Vodafone for more than 6 months I still haven't seen a Vodafone person and we just get swung thru call centres trying to find a solution. 
After 10 years of being a customer who thought it was 'OK' and to trying to support a bit of competition.....it has hit rock bottom. I am on my way to a Telstra store to switch every connection over.  Just should never have happened.",1
Extremely poor customer service,"Extremely shocking services, even the people who work on facebook don't keep their promise. I hope the shareholders hear the problems on facebook. I think the ombudsman is the best way to get answersIf you have a business DON'T go with Vodafone as the customer service is shocking and you will spend hours and multiple calls to get things done.",1
Good quality service,"Iâ€™m happy I signed up with Vodafone they give a fair deal with data and mobile plan itâ€™s a great service my phone is good I enjoy using it and it easy to use and has good features Iâ€™m very pleased with it, it was worth my money purchasing thins phone",4
Always get an issue resolved,"I have a post paid account & have always experienced excellent coverage in NSW & VIC. I really appreciate emails telling me I am close to exceeding my data limit & any time I have had a handset issue it has been resolved efficiently & in a very reasonable time. And yes, it is an overseas call centre but wherever they are their English is very good.",5
Bad customer service,"Everytime i ring Vodafone I cant understand a word there saying at all and im always say ""pardin pardon i cant understand youAnd when ive had someone that speaks a bit clearer well they just talked right over me and asking me the same question 4 or 5 times!!  My plan is up soon n im dreading to call them",2
Terrible Terrible Terrible,"On 27th Oct, I went in Store to pre-order the Iphone X. the Sales promised me to get the phone by the end of Nov, as I told him I would fly overseas at 24th Nov for three months. Sales also promised that if I could not receive the item by time, I could cancel the order anytime.tock limit. 

I don't even get the phone and I did not sign the contract! The sale said he would order for me. Just it. And now I am suck in the 3 year contract and only can get phone 4 months later if the courier not returned it back.",1
Would rate a Zero if it was an option,"Bought a phone that stopped working 16 days later. (Would not boot up, and would not turn off again.)Vodafone refuse to refund it, or replace it on the spot.Instead they will send it away for repair/replacement, a process which will take 2 weeks.
Have not heard back from Vodafone since I forwarded their response (ie ""Refunding the device isn't something we can do"") to the TIO.

Avoid purchasing from Vodafone if you actually want consumer rights.

They fully deserve their abysmal 1.6 average score.",1
Poor service ever never,"After I withdraw my mobile number with Vodafone for last 2months, they just kept sending me the bills.About $214 for last two months with no explanation and just a number on the invoice.I hope vodaphone shut down straightway, don't hurt the customers anymore plz.",1
Vodafone - WOEFUL - Refuse to exchange a brand new faulty iPhone,"Totally dissatisfied with so called Customer Service.  Received my new iPhone 8 Plus and upon setting it up and taking a few photos to check it out, screen just locked.  IPhone 8 Plus and upon setting it up and taking a few photos to check it out, screen just locked. Next issue, the phone keep turning off showing just the Apple logo, this would be stuck for 2 and 3 hours at a time. When it did stop, I finally managed to make a phone call and halfway through my conversation, it switched off again, for another 3 hrs.e echo resulting in not being able to hear the person on the other end properly and keep on having to get them to repeat what they said. I compared voice audio with my daughters iPhone 8 Plus and there is clearly an issue with my phone. 

I had the phone less than 2 weeks, rang Vodafone, and was told they will only swap the phone if the fault was reported within 24hrs of receiving it. What a load of rubbish. have since discovered it's actually 30 days and they'll replace it.

So I go into the store in Doncaster Vic, the guy there tells me to take it upstairs to Apple. So I go to Apple and they tell me there's at least a 3hr wait. I left as I didn't have time to wait that long.

A few days later I go to Vodafone Chadstone, the lady does an upgrade on my phone, the audio is still terrible, and the switching off is still occurring but not as often.

Worst customer service,"customer service lady was rude and bossy. there was no need to be so condescending, i'm so happy to be moving to a different network.",1

Boycott Vodafone. Consumers should remember that they have the power to punish unscrupulous telcos l,"Let us boycott Vodafone, the unscrupulous telecom who sucks customers blood by overcharging, breaching contracts and bad service. Consumers have the power and it's only unity that is needed to bring them to their senses. So, boycott Vodafone today. Leave the network and give them unforgettable lesson only then they begin to respect consumers. Boycott Vodafone. Now!!!!",1
Boycott Vodafone. Consumers should remember that they have the power to punish unscrupulous telcos l,"Hi,Here are the issues:1. Vodafone Australia breached section 18 of the ACL in enticing me that because of my loyalty Vodafone offered me a better product and put me on a new plan which was in effect more profitable to the company and harmful to me. This offer is evidenced by the txt message Vodafone sent to me. The ultimate consequence was that was Vodafone charged 116 dollars instead of $35.00
The australia.consumer law more specifically competition and consumer Act (Cth) 2010 provides:
Section 18: no misleading and deceptive conduct in trade or commerce.
Section 29: no false or deceptive representation.
A breach of which attracts both civil and criminal penalties.
In light of the above provisions of the act, consider this statement from Vodafone:

We've recently launched some fantastic new plans and as a loyal customer we wanted you to be one of the first to get them. From 4.12.2017, you will notice we have moved you onto the new $50 SIM Only Month to Month plan. For full plan details, read the Critical Information Summary at https://vfau.co/ukxqu  If you want to explore other options please contact 1555 from your mobile.
2. Vodafone , without any regard to my consent , has forcefully put me on a plan which does not meet my needs and overcharges me. 

3. Because Vodafone has got the details of my credit/ debit card, they should be stopped from charging my credit card. ( I'm told this is resolved)

4. When I was transferred from 3 network to vodafone as a result of the acquisition of the former by the latter, I was charged twice because Vodafone bills in advance. So, when I leave the network I should not pay the last bill.

A speedy resolution of the dispute may avoid further escalation.",1
Network Coverage is too bad,"Vodafone Australia is worst mobile service provider in Australia. I have signed up for 24 months plan and most of the time my phone does not work due to pure network coverage I have contacted Vodafone many time but they said there is maintenance going in my area and it will be resolved soon but this never happens in last 24 months. There is no network in city centre train line. when I have raised complain about this, funny response I got from Vodafone team that they can only guaranty network coverage to my home location not other location, come on really than what is the point of mobile if they can not provide coverage other than home address, I have landline connection for home. Finally I have completed my contract period and moving to Telstra.",1
No overseas roaming,I landed at London's Heathrow airport and turned on my phone. There was no signal indicating that the phone was useless to use in the UK. But I was not to be without a phone. I went to a UK Vodafone shop and got a prepaid sim card. I was unable to top it up electronically because I didn't have a UK home address. So I just visited a UK Vodafone shop of which there are many in the UK and they loaded it for me and activated it for me too. It meant a changed phone number but at least I could arrange accommodation in advance and keep in touch with family back here in Australia.,2
Worst 4g internet speed,"On 4g network the speed is as low as 3g from long time. Using expensive plan of $85. Telstra, optus is better than vodafone..",1
Great!,"I've been a Vodafone customer for a very long time, I've taken advantage of their plans and deals. Most of the time loyal customers are given special deals such as free data, calls, and texts. For the most part I'm extremely satisified with this. But sometimes I have to wait a ridiculously long time for a customer support person to speak to me.",4
Helpful Service!,"I was billed for $20 for using extra 2 GB on my current plan. I called them and they waived $10 and  give extra 1 GB for free, just because I was nice to them. You can get better services if you are a better customer. I am with Vodafone since 2011. I had always problem with my plan but whenever I call they helped me with any matters.",5
Promises &amp; deceit,Promised $200 trade in for working Note 3 (Upgrading to Note 8).Went to get trade in & was told that cracked screen nullifies offer.Promises & deceit.,1
Impossible to cancel contract,"Approached by cold call for business contract which i accepted, when the bill turned up before the Sim card and they tell me the Sim card is active! I cancelled the contract after hrs arguing on the phone and online chat to o/s call center they agreed to end contract with no charges, a few weeks later a bill for $483 appeared with $38 monthly charges after hrs online i gave up and i expect the billing will go to recovery agency with all the others! Don't start me on Yellow pages and Commander.",1
Vodafone services are crap,Last month....I have just been charged more than 80 dollars on my plan....isn't that disgusting.....Vodafone should be banned....they have been taking our money for no reason......Wanna leave Vodafone now.....getting deceived from Vodafone services these days.....,1
Automatically adding data,I'll be changing from Vodafone because they add data automatically I was once charged an extra $200!! Because I fell asleep I have to leave 100MB a month just so I don't get charged extra.,3
Disgraceful,"Had constant drop outs and minimal if not non existant service even at my home address. Made numerous complaints to their tech support. On one occasion, the phone dropped out while I was on the phone complaining about this. I then get a txt msg we are unable to call you back as your phone is switched off or not in range it was in my hand as I was waiting for a call back! But they still told me there wasn't an issue with my coverage and serviceability. Then once I cancelled the service they have the nerve to charge me a huge pay out figure. DISGRACEFUL!!!",1
"This is terrible, cheating customers by hiding real information","Network's coverage is poor. They are cheating customers. They promise a lot of benefits to customers. In fact, they are cheating customers. If you really check the plans, you would understand that they are ripping off us. These liars won't say everything when you are going to sign a contract. Even the contract copy they give us doesn't say what happens in case you want to cancel the contract even the next day.Completely cheating. Recently I came to know about these things. Now I am unable to move. They have somehow locked me in. Trying to find a way to get out of it.",1
Not an honest company,"We had the messaging service for one year, then we did not need it anymore, we cancelled in Sep 16. After 6 months they restarted the service without our authority and send us a bulk bill for the 6 months. Every time we ring to cancel, the excuse is: no cancellation received. And again they stopped for a while and re-activated the service recently without authority. A complaint was lodged with TIO.Edit: now is December 2017 and I still have not got a satisfactory solution even through TIO, Vodafone has been sitting on our refund for over 3 months and still has not been released.",1
Not an honest company,We have just received our refund from Vodafone after 7 months of making a complaint to TIO. We will never connect through Vodafone ever.,1
Unrealistic customer service,Could not understand most of what I was saying and continually repeating myself 3 or 4 times. Not very helpful and ended up hanging up without any resolution.All this and I was only trying to pay my account which is still not resolved.,1
Hidden costs,I received messages that Vodafone had added 1GB data as they say I have used all my shared data. I turned off my mobile data hoping that I would not exceed anymore until my inclusions reset. But the next day I received a txt message again that I have used up all my extra data. How did that happened???,1
Signal is as good as telstra,"I am with vodafone for 2 years. In the car park of apartment, no signal with vodafone but it's ok with my other telstra mobile.",3
Blatantly Dishonest &amp; deceitful Sales practices,"Totally unsatisfactory illegal withholding information as to the Plans they have available: falsely Answered question, in order to sell longer Data Plan, & thus increasing sales commission.",1
No loyalty offers for existing customers,"I have been with vodafone for the past 23 months with note 5 as my phone. I wanted to upgrade to new note 8 plans. No benefits for being a loyal customer. Not even a single dollar value. I get whats being offered to a new customer. Also, unlimited calls feature has been removed. Not worth being on another 24 or 36 months for no layalty offers. Unfortunately, the customer service reps are too bad in even discussing about it. Will never go back to them again. They donâ€™t value the existing customers at all.",1
Unexpected $560 out of the blue charge,Just got paid today looked at bank account and shock $560 gone to these criminals like how can they begin to justify that.,1
Very bad service and unpromising policies,Staff in this outlet has very low level understanding of English. Went for earphone warranty and they said it can not be replaced without any convincing reason. Vodafone is actually pathetic in customer service and the way they charge extra for data is also totally unsatisfactory. Not worth recommending.,2
Sim Card Crap,Useless people. Can't help you without an automated system. Can't change your number from 1 Sim to another without an automated system.,1
Loyal customer for over 12 years means nothing to vodafone,"I have Been with Vodafone for over 12 years and never had any issues until February 2017. I hate that I can never speak to someone in Australia and they ask me the same questions and recommend the same advice which has already been done for eg try the sim in a different device and new SIM card. Every time I need to make a call Or receive a call I have to be outdoors otherwise it cuts out of reception. Vodafone tell me that they have full coverage where I am located. I have a brand new iPhone 7 and brand new Vodafone SIM card and still doesn't work. I have tried the SIM card in spare iPhones and the same thing happens the reception drops out so I know it's Vodafone. 
They can't do anything for me except charge me $800 to cancel the plan. So much for the thousands of dollars I have spent and been a loyal customer all these years. I lived in this same suburb before and never had these issues. I have also lived all around Australia and never had theSe issues. 
Very upset and disappointed after all these years I always recommend and spoke highly of vodafone but not anymore! I will never recommend them again.  I pay $119 plan every month",1
The Worst Experience,"Keep away from the huawei g8 or any huawei phone,  had the phone less then a year vodafone sent it to there repairer  and tried to charge me $20 a week for a small cheap trmporary phone. Vodafone  said it was liquid damage and it was my fault so therefore I'm not covered!!!! They said the phone is damage and can't be fixed!!!I took the phone to another  repairer his fixed it and said there was no liquid damage!!!!!!! And still vodafone denise it. And the  excuses from vodafone how liquid can get in your phone are ridiculous, so bad worse exexperience keep away from vodafone!!!",1
DISGUST at the lies they make their teenage staff tell!!!,"Been with this mob for 20 months - horrible horrible experience. I lost it in two if their stores in Brisbane when the entire teenage staff ganged up and stood behind the laughing staff employee who insisted the manager was on annual leave in the two stores she took me to. I told her outright ""you are lying ... why?""  I had travelled an hour to return an iPad 4 days after it arrived. Was promised a 14 day cooling off period was in place and what do you have to lose?Apparently my sanity!!!! In 4 minutes months I move on and plan to celebrate leaving this disaster of a so called company. Teach your young employees to honour your policies not lie their behinds off. DISGUSTED.

March 5th 2018 Update: Unethical tactics!!

Left Vodafone 4 months before contract up. Continual mistakes w overcharging. Optus credited me 70 on my second months bill towards the cancellation charge for going with them. Vodafone have made my life hell for leaving. Quoted 199 for payout which somehow ballooned to $350 and REFUSED to take payments even tho I'm 75 and a pensioner. 
Optus are great! Total opposite to deal with. So although it's been horrible it's worth it in the end to not give my
Business to these heartless (wish I could swear) people.",1
Beware of their sales rep online,I was asking regarding an upgrade for a postpaid plan and ownership transfer online on live chat. I was told to upgrade and I could do the transfer after. Not once did the rep mentioned anything about if I transfer ownership after the upgrade none of the bonus offered will be transferred. If I knew I should have just ported to Optus as they had a better deal without having to negotiate for more data for being a loyal customer for many years. Once they upgraded the plan they just say another department is in charge and to call to transfer. Walk into a store the next day and was told that I should have done the transfer before upgrading the plan because no bonus will be transferred. Absolutely disgusted by the sales team for not mentioning this as all they care about is getting you to upgrade and stay with them. Case is currently now in dispute.,1
Vodafoney,"Customer Service is pitiful, unhelpful, obstructive, misleading, embarrassing.  $200 dollars for a loan phone to replace the broken phone they sold me.  then the wait time went from five days to ten days.  Pure Rubbish. Voda Phoney.",1
Why i got rid of vodaphone,Vodaphone sends me a text asking why I'm leaving them. It says pick from multiple choices. Ten Questions but the whole ten questions have the same multiple choices. Whats the point when I can not tell them in writing in my own words. Telstra gave me the chance to upgrade from my old iPhone 4s to an iPhone 6 at a good price owned out right and put me on a plan for $35. Only $5 more than my $3o recharge on vodaphone. The plan is only for 12 months than I can go back to my $30 recharge option. The phone $529 and some Telstra stores sold for $449. Good price for a good upgrade seeing we are on the old age pension. If vodaphone want good honest feed back it should let people tell them in their own words not pick from repeated same useless questions. After all we do give feed back by our own free will. When going online with vodaphone it is very slow. They throw bonus gigs at you but way too slow. If it was not for my wi fi connection to tpg hooked up to my phone the internet on my old phone would just take forever to respond. Ps I was with vodaphone ten years at least. In the end the product and price point were just not there. I'm not looking for $70 a month plans and $1000 outright phones just a good phone and deal.,2
Great experiance,"What can I say, fantastic experience, much better than telstra no regrets moving, customer service A+ I will be moving more services across",5
Vodafone is so good,"In short, you went to the store sign up for new phone plan for 2 years contract. After 2 years you have to CANCEL your phone plan by contact ""VODAFONE"", you can't cancel your Phone plan At The ""SAME"" Store (the server are bad. Totally deeply poor).In the end, lesson learn, never go with wonderPhone, because you don't know what feeling they will amaze you with after you sign up with them. So stay safe and keep out of ""WonderPhone"".",1
Complete lack of customer service.,"Bought a phone less than 3 months ago that behaved like a piece of crap.  Wasted one afternoon returnig  the htc u ultra to be told it was all sorted out the back of the shop.  Crap.  Bluetooth still sounds linke a grammaphone.  Spent another after noon being told they'd  fix it but it would take seven days and requires a $200 retainer.  I have two phones with these scumbags and ive never missed a payment after ten years. Great customer trust.  Crap service, crap customer care.  Dont buy from these scumbags.  Will pay out my two phone  contracts and try someone reliable.",1
Vodafone - A migrant nightmare,"It all started around 23 months 20 days back when we took two sim and phone plans with 24 months lock in.id a huge mistake. I kept on raising issues every 4-6 months until about 6 months back when i was informed that the area in which you are staying offers no outdoor connectivity and limited outdoor. I was dumbstruck and informed that the call disconnect issues are also in my balcony. So, they said that limited outdoor means you have to go to the street to make a call. Seriously!!

When I raised, I WAS INFORMED THAT SINCE I CHANGED MY HOUSE AFTER SIGNING THE CONTRACT,  NOTHING CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT.

I have raised it with TIO and vodafone is paying me a couple of 100 dollars back. However, with the trauma that I have faced, I would suggest you all not to opt for it especially, if you are staying near Parramatta/ Westmead/ Wentworthville/ Marylands.

BEWARE PEOPLE!!!",1
Outages,"If you live on the Gold Coast in these areas and you have Vodafone as your services provider ask for credits as these areas have been identified by Vodafone as having service issues - No doubt they never told you....Arundel, Ashmore, Parkwood, Labrador, Runaway Bay, Paradise Point, Southport, Surfers Paradise, Bundall, Helensvale, Benowa, Pacific Pines, Broadbeach, Miami Coomera, Upper Coomera, Hope Island, Nerang, Hollywell, Highland Park, Robina, Varsity Lakes, Mudgeeraba Carrara and Main Beach.",1
Not happy.,"Upgraded handset and was told that when my plan ended would be able to go on a much cheaper $29 plan + pay the same handset instalments as I go... Time passes and when my plan did indeed end I'm told that if I want the $29 plan I have to pay off the handset in one go, otherwise go on a $50 plan with instalments. They're just liars, I'm very frustrated and disappointed. No clarity and plenty of empty promises that they can't back up. Very expensive compared to other companies, I'm sure of it.",1
Staff.....why such staff?,"Coverage is fine. Prepaid plan which is value for money. Staff interactions are obstructive , ageist and patronising. problem solving or sorting out customer difficulties seems to be a power that resides with some other person who is unable to be specified or contacted in any reasonable time. Time for them to upgrade training and to sort out what their objectives are in actually running forums or other social media .I am actually kind of grateful that i have had this experience because i was going to look at their rumoured NBN service. I cannot begin to imagine how they will deal with all the problems around that service.",1
Hidden charges everywhere! and you are just a number to them!,Customer service lady was polite but keep justifying how they are entitled to charge customer. You can't ask for the data to be capped - they will keep charging you if you go over. They treat customer like a number.,1
Bad bad bad,I have used vodafone for 2 years and i have find that they are very bad and not trusted company any as i lost so much money by cheating.,1
Never again!,Having so many problems with network coverage and when i call to resolve the problem not one person can speak good english so a call that should be 10min ends up nearly an hour after one problem is solved there is another i changed my payment details 3 times online each time didnt work and finally said it was being reviewed the time came when my bill needed to be paid and it didnt go through i called up and payed immediately and was still charged a $15 late fee telling me their system was down and my payment details wernt changed but i was still at fault because i should have called,1
Don't use Vodafone!!! Disgusting Customer Service!!!!,"No phone coverage for 3 Days traveling from Western Australia to South Australia!!! SOS mode!!!!!

I hate calling every time to pay over the phone its a big hassle for me. Im moving both my accounts away to someone else.,1
Great customer service,Staff in store are always patient and super helpful. Haven't had any issues with their coverage. Can't complain about anything.,5
Customer services need better training,"We have three plans with Vodaphone for seven years they were good at some stage but the worse thing when having an issue, you need long time to spend with the customer services on the phone, also they don't care if the company loose customers, however thank you Vodaphone for the years we were together, we are moving to another company.",3
Below Zero Vodafail,"The network coverage failed to deliver on national & international roaming. Ongoing lies, shocking customer service, technical support & complaints unit to investigate. They promise to repair & fix ongoing making my holiday a living hell. Hours, days weeks trying to seek help. They finally admit fault making a mistake when it's too late. Further investigation I had to provide numerous time IMEI they couldn't verify -  They refuse to pay out of pocket expenses. I bought the handset locked to vodafone on prepaid. They kept asking me to recharge, recharge, data hardly worked.",1
Worst experience,Vodafone is the worst. Their service is the crappiest ever. You can't get network any where. When you go to their outlets the csrs are the most useless rudest people to deal with and when you call their call centre to cancel the people over there rather than solving your problem is only after signing you up for another contract. It is not worth the money which is quite high for the level of service. Terrible experience!!!,1
Appalling customer service - borderline on fraud,"Back in April, I paid $693 for a bill - expensive, yes, but me and my family used a lot of data/txt addons. I'm not complaining about the size of the bill.On the 1st of August, Vodafone says the payment was reversed/rejected, and credited to my account for an unknown reason, and that I would need to pay the bill again. To this day, I still have not received that refund. Two days ago, I was forced to pay the bill a 2nd time after constant threats of phone service disconnection.arly $700, waiting for a refund that's somehow disappeared into the ether. Vodafone staff hopeless, say they cannot trace the funds, blaming it on my bank.
After several phone calls and live chats and getting the run-around, I have opened a credit card dispute with my bank. I'm not sure when/if I'll see that money again, but I will fight.

Never been so angry with a company before.",1
The worst company to deal with,Extremely dissatisfied with the recent experience.They do not  even repair or replace a phone that is still under warranty.I'm on the process of Working my matter with the ombudsmen.I'm still under contract with them but refused to solve the hearing issue but still want me to pay extra for it. Now they say there is dint in my phone which did not exist before. Never ever believe them.,1
Worst experience ever,"Thought I'd try Vodafone big mistake! Bad reception bad customer service, I ordered a mobile and tablet, I received 4 tablets and two phones, over charged massively for 3 months credits took 6 months, hours on customer service with no resolution.. ended up paying out the contract so I didn't have to deal with this horrible company",1
prepaid vodafone not cheap but its good,"I like this mobile network as my prepaid card because when i run out my data, I still could access their top up website without problem. they also provide vodafone application for us to do recharge or track our used history.for the price is fair. 1st customer offer 50% off. thats good deal.",4
worst company,Very poor network converge . They don't network guarantee. Vodafone big scam network guarantee. They refusing to fix the issue and cancelling the contract,1
Not recommending to anyone to go with vodaphone,My mobile causing problem 3rd time as per their policy i have right to replacement but disappointed with their team. I wasn't offered much option or i can say equivalent or better option so decided to change the provider...been with voda phone from last 6 year does not worth anything and also earning others too.,1
"Best data for money, good value, loyal customers get better deals","Fantastic, answers quick and can usually sort out everything, live chat is simple and it is easy to use online",4
Vodafone travel SCAM,"Beware Vodafone scam of offering a 30 day network guarantee but refusing to refund any money when their SIM does not work. I have tried to seek action from Vodafone UK and Australia but neither respond.The text of the Vodafone scam is below. Beware DO NOT under any circumstance buy a SIM from Vodafone. They cannot be trusted, their SIM doesn't work, they make false representations and advertising and infringe across multiple laws. They'd rather do this than simply refund Â£45 for a SIM that never worked.--------I bought a Â£45 SIM 89441000300743284972 from Heathrow 10 August but when I arrived at Covent Garden your SIM would not reach my wife's Estonia mobile number. I visited your Long Acre store who said I needed to spend more money to reach the Estonia number. Still my phone could not dial the Estonia number, the SOLE and only number I wanted to be able to dial. After a subsequent visit to Long Acre your staff said Vodafone cannot call Estonian numbers but refused to refund my purchase, despite your very large 30 day network guarantee signage throughout the store. They insisted I had a Vodafone SIM but it was not a Vodafone network, the network means just their store. You are clearly breaching all contract and consumer law and making false representations and advertising. 
I went to the neighbouring 3 store and within minutes I could contact the Estonian number. 
I leave the UK on Tuesday but on my return to Australia will complain to Vodafone Australia about your misleading conduct and write to the British High Commissioner in Canberra. I will also report your actions to Westpac bank and seek that they make a chargeback for this purchase against Vodafone. There was not a single call made on this SIM. I have photos of your Long Acre staff who refused to supply their details, photos of the store and of your advertising signage of a network guarantee at the store which your staff refused to honour.",1
My account is totally of no use,"Vodafone gave a 30 day money back guarantee to sign up with them.  That should have been a warning sign in itself.  The coverage was really poor (internet as well as phone) and here were claims that I was in a reception black hole, although not so as the reception was equally bad at my mum's place.  Continual promises that there were upgrades to be completed in the area but my reception was always just as bad.  Then instead of the service improving it is still slow but now my data is being used up 2 -3 times faster and they charge me $10 for every gig that I go over.  How much worse can it get?  My supposed bonus gigs disappeared over night, so now I have half the gigs and when I inquired they tried to force me onto a new contract and now say that I can no longer have the bonus gigs without any kind of reason.  How stupid does Vodafone think that people are?",1
Such a hassle to ask about extra charges,I constantly get extra charges on things I have no idea why when there's nowhere on the bill that explains anything even with the detailed bills. Tried to call up about it and they asked for a four digit pin which I told them and they said it was incorrect and then they asked me a series of questions about my identity which they kept telling me was wrong. I think I know who I am better than you Vodafone.,1
Worst Customer Nightmare,"My experience with Vodafone is one of the worst experiences in my life. If I could give a NEGATIVE score I would have done so immediately. I've been a loyal customer for such a long time and tried to switch networks. I called them to at least match the offer on a certain day and time since the other provider's last day for the promo was on that day. They told me that I have to call back on a Monday. We've been going back and forth...I was redirected to another department saying that the other department will give a better offer. In reality, they couldn't match what the other provider was offering. The question was answerable by a YES or NO but they dragged things for so long in order to keep me. I mean if you are unable to match an offer just say so don't be selfish and waste my time. What a disaster! I've wasted so much time for nothing. I'll be sharing my personal experience with Vodafone to hundreds of people I know. NEVER AGAIN will I recommend someone to Vodafone ever again like I used to in the past. (Sorry, pretty mad right now due to my recent experience). I'll probably encourage them to switch networks.

Also, whenever a call is made it is monitored and recorded for training purposes. Customers have NO option of having it turned off.
Furthermore, CUSTOMERS have NO option of online chat support unless they have an account under Vodafone. They can fill out a form? I mean are you really kidding me in this day and age. What they offer LOYAL customers are the ones already on their website or they make offers after going through a series of departments. Do not ever sign up for their services or you'll regret it.",1
Worst Company To Deal With,"Bill was $260 per month for 24 months under contract and 1st month out of contract was $607.19. Nearly impossible to talk to anyone poor English, can't make a decision say they will call back and when they do it's with a recorded voice saying press 1 to talk to someone, press 1 10 times doesn't work and to top it off they have blackspots and bad coverage as soon as you leave the city. Will NEVER deal with this company ever again should have learnt the 1st time HORRIBLE SERVICE. Have to agree with all the reviews on this page they are on the money.",1
WORST customer service,"The store staff that we've dealt with at werribe was superstar however ALL the phone line customer service are very rude, not helpful and will talk back to you and question you with anger when they could not solve your problem. My bf overpaid the bill and when I ask for a refund they could not guarantee to refund and when all I wanna do is terminate the contract they told me to call back by end of month billing period. They also charge you so much for late payment fee if you are on a contract with lack of notice. I even lost word what to say more about my experience. My advise is if you guys want to deal with the worst customer service ever please join vodafone.",1
"Worse, too many hidden charges","The sales people give you different story, the online guys tell you something else. I signed up for 50 dollar plan but have been paying 80. They keep giving me different reason every month. Do not fall for them.",1
Ongoing nightmare,"Signing up with Vodafone has been the worst consumer experience of my life... no exaggeration. I've been a constant victim of overbilling!I wish I had checked out ProductReview before signing up with them.EVERY. SINGLE. BILL I have received is inflated. I have to call them every month to reverse charges, with limited success. It is so exhausting and frustrating dealing with their India based call agents that I have given up and simply accept the higher bills!
- Rude and deceitful staff at the their Rundle Mall branch. 
- So many more thing that I'll avoid goinginto due to time constraints...",1
Useless support and horrible signal,"Every month or 2 I have had to contact Vodafone about issues with my billing, issues with my signal, issues with the app, pretty much anything you can think of, I've had problems. The support team are aggressive and useless. Considering this is an Australian company (Vodafone Australia, that is) I'd appreciate if they kept their call centre local and gave jobs to people in this country, rather than India based workers.",1
Terrible coverage &amp; annoying spam texts,"When my SIM card arrived in the mail, the activation number had a white line running through it, making it barely readable. Phone support tole me to take it into the nearest store - that wasted a couple hours of my day.",1
Charged me $10 for using 10mb of data!,"Maxed out my data plan so they automatically charged me $10 for 1gb of data. When I tried to reverse the charge they said that because i'd used 10mb (0.097) % of the gigabite i had to pay. OMFG, NOT IMPRESSED!!!",1
Just don't try to leave or switch,"Had been a Vodafone customer for more than 15 years and never had an issue or had to ring customer servicerecently moved house and have no Vodafone reception (not their fault).Rang customer service (CS) they were helpful and offered several possibilities to improve signal, None worked (not their fault).ied to use their web site (www...vodafone/unlock) did not work, site just timed out after i entered phones IEM no rang CS, was told there were issues with website and they could do it for me. They logged a request with their tech team and was told i would be contacted within 24 hours with unlock procedure. Happy customer
Guess what : NO one called me back
I rang CS back, was told they are unable to unlock my phone and that i spoke to no one the previous day and that no request had been made to unlock phone and no one was going to call me back. Refused to check who i spoke with even though they keep that data. Was told the only way i could unlock phone was to visit Vodafone store, Explained this was not possible and they refused to unlock phone.

1 Star along with the other 1000 Australian people on here.,"As with 1000 other unsatisfied customers, I am not happy but I guess that's what happens when companies are sold OFFSHORE to FOREIGNERS who only want PROFIT. They are trying to charge me for a contract I did not agree to, stay far away from these pure scum, I would like to have a personal run in with the CEO, it wouldn't be pretty. Stay away from our (the Australian people)'s country! We don't want your crappy business and terrible customer service.",1
Vodafone target the elderly,"Thought I'd review the absolutely appalling experience recently of dealing with Vodafone on behalf of an elderly (80+) friend.  She has been with Vodafone since at least 2002.  She mainly goes into her local store when she has problems.  Unknown to my husband and I, who are VERY technically savy, she has been constantly being told untrue, misleading and downright wrong information about the mobiles she has had.re, ""Oh you again, you always cause trouble when you come in here don't you?""
Keep in mind this is a small woman in her eighties.  By trouble they mean she keeps bringing up problems that weren't fixed in previous visits.  Way to respect customers Vodafone.

She had finally had enough and decided to switch mobile carriers.  She owns the mobile in question, having paid for it outright and is contract free.  My husband switched over the sim cards only to see a message wanting a sim unblock code to be entered.
He rang Vodafone, with our friend beside him and she gave him authorisation to speak on her behalf.  She gave her name, address, pin code and license number three different times and each time they spoke to either her or my husband.  

One worker told us to, ""Just go to the store and they can put in the code, it's easier that way.""  The worker claimed that the store had the codes, ""in their computers, we don't.""  Husband laughed out loud and said he found it hard to believe that a store would be able to offer more technical support than an actual worker from Vodafone already on the line.  Then we were supplied with a website that would talk us through the unblocking, again being told, it's just easier that way.  Did we by chance get a worker who answered the phone but was running late for his break?

Vodafone sucks!,"Please avoid Vodafone, it took me more than 1.5 hours (3 attempts - online, live chat and phone) to activate a prepaid starter sim. It was very frustrating and when I asked them a question (the expiry date of my sim), I got 3 different answers from 3 different customer care officers.  I have activated prepaid sims from other service providers previously and I can tell you Vodafone is the worst to deal with.",1
Completely rubbish service and network,"Don't recommended to any one for vodafone.No network coverage at all. Paying bill for nothing just hang on phone with customer service and keep talking and no resolution . Better to go good provider like Telstra, Optus..",1
Nightmare experience with customer service,Vodafone kindly fix your poor customer service?! Your operators are so rude and impatient! I am your loyal customer. I'm just gonna finish my contract and that's it! No more upgrades under your company!,1
Contract finished thank GOD,"Been with Vodafone for 8years and finally walking away, rip offs have had just enough now I'm switching to something affordable and honest company.",1
"Poor service, provided modem pathetic","Where to start. I signed up for a postpaid mobile service because they had a double data deal. 8GB for the price of 4GB - $30 a month. Straight away the issues started. The 4g modem is pathetic. The battery life is just over an hour so you always need to be near a power source. Unlike the last 3g modem I had this does not show battery life on the device so you have to sign into pocket wifi to check, which is an annoyance. The device ALWAYS drops out and you have to disconnect then reconnect to get service again. This occurs AT LEAST every 15-20 minutes. Don't even bother trying to get in contact with Vodafone to discuss the issues, they have designed a system making it almost impossible to make contact. We tried to get additional data and for 5 days their website said it would be uploaded in 5-15 minutes. I have now gone over and they have immediately charged me $10 for additional data usage. Throughout the past 5 days I have tried to contact them multiple times via the following methods; live chat (timed out 6 times), call back service (it called me back, said I was being transferred then just disconnected), and now I have been waiting on hold for half an hour despite being told it would be a 10 minute wait. Do not bother with this company, pay the extra and go with a company you will get decent service with.",1
Faster than a SNAIL,"4G 1/5, 3G 4/5 buy slower than a snail.2 years Contract, I'm stuck please helppp!!!Ripped off rather than value.0-100? -100 if possible.",1
"Vodafone, can you be more dishonest, tricky, and thieving?","Poor company in Aus ever used!i hope there is a negative rate!!My bill says i sent a message called Premium message and costed 4.54$ on the number 19940004 on 22/7! what hell, i never sent any messages to this number!!!And this 80$ redcap includes 3 hrs international call, and i only made 3 international calls this month, which were 11mins, 15mins,and 1hr, and the total is far less than 3 hrs! then the bill says there were 3 extra charges for international call!!!! then  Vodafone charged me about 16$ more in total for those calls!! Why?It is a nightmare when using this company.Stay away from this company!I hope this dishonest and thieving Vodafone closing down straightway.",1
Too many problems,"I tried configuring my phone to receive/send mms by installing the vodafone software for my model, it installed correctly and I pressed ok, but I still can't send/receive mms (with data turned on).The worst was when my grandfather  passed away and i tried to rechargeso i could call overseas but their 1511 and help line numbers were not working. I went into the store and they told me it was a technical problem and they didn't know when it would be fixed.  It was a day or two later when their numbers were working again. The apology to their customers and bonus data was of little comfort. Their service usually drops out in the middle of a call as well.",1
Mobile contract finished.,"After being a loyal customer for two years I decided to switch my phone to dodo for a cheaper plan my mobile contract have already finished and have no plans to renew anymore with Vodafone, on my last bill they are charging me $600 extra dollars for exit fee how ridiculous is that!! Vodafone is the worst poison eats ever to rip you off, my worst nightmare company exit fee money after contract have finished.",1
Horrible customer service,My average plan for a few services comes in at $450Sometimes there's unexpected bills or medical and Vodafone are heartless no care for there customers I had an extension in may and tried to get another today they refused saying only 1 extension every 3 months anyone on plans go to another provider they treat you like crapBut if your a new customer they will suck up to get money out of you,1
Horrible customer service,"They are very rude still I spoke to them today and they put me threw to a department that was closedThis company Vodafone make my blood boil !!!They are extremely heartless I have things threw Telstra and I find Telstra very understanding and helpful .. 
go to Telstra or another provider stay clear from Vodafone please",1
Terrible customer service,"I just signed up for a new 24 months contract and got a new iphone 7plus. I purchased a new protective cover to go with my phone, which was highly recommended by the sales person and paid separately for that as well. The very next day I couldn't switch my phone on or off and found that the cover was to blame. I took it back to the same store here at Hobart City and was told it could not be exchanged or refunded if I didn't have the original cover for it. Now I'm not normally keeping every single cover and packaging for everything I ever buy, but was lucky to retrieve the iphone cover packaging from the bin. I went back to the store the next day again (I had to pay for someone to mind my  own store for that time) with the original packaging and the Eftpos receipt I was given and was then told by the staff at Vodafone that the case was already ""dodgy"" when they put my new phone into it on the first day! They then told me that my receipt wasn't good enough and that they had to go through their system to find the original receipt. I waited patiently for about 10 minutes while they apparently searched their computer for it, while at the same time serving other customers. I then said that I had to go back to work and how long they thought this would take, to which they replied it could take all day!!! I said that that was ridiculous and that I couldn't understand such a store policy, especially as I had my Eftpos receipt and had only signed up for a new contract the day before!! The store manager seemed to get annoyed and told me to go back to work and come back later, which I declined. Altogether I spent more than 1 hour at the store waiting for what they claimed was the original receipt, after which I demanded my receipt and cover back and left rather upset at such appalling customer service!!  When I got back to my own business I was still shaking and my daughter had to the Vodafone complaint line who helped to resolve the issue for me. I now got a refund of $37 and can still not believe that it took three days for Vodafone to refund (as they didn't have a replacement case instore) that rather small amount and to make everything so incredibly difficult, when they will surely make a tidy sum of the new contract I signed?! Very poor customer service Vodafone!!!",1
The worst provider,All I can say is don't go with VodafoneI've had a really bad experianceNo service at allI'm not happy with Vodafone,1
Never have had an issue!,When it comes down to it all phone companies are the same... yes the network coverage in the country isn't as good... But I don't need it and i'm not paying a premium for it.,5
Bunch of con artists,"After my post paid plan contract expired.Went for a more affordable month to month plan over the phone. However, they conned me and somehow added extra $20 for some extra broadband which I never asked for, ever needed or ever have used.",1

Ok,"As a valuable customer of Vodafone for the last four years I can give you my recommendation. Plans with Vodafone are terrible if like me you use ALOT of data. I paid a ridiculous amount for the plan, probably 3 times as much as the phone would of cost me outright brand new!Thankfully I am no longer on a plan, HOWEVER I can give better feedback on prepaid and value is alot better. Also data add ons are amazing. Would recommend pre paid not plans. In some areas service could be better. Reception in my house is crap.",3
Terrible,Dishonest .the staff we tell u anything to get u to sign up..scammers the reception is poor .Plus many other problems,1
Terrible. Don't fall for it. Customer service poor and bills are overrated,Don't buy. This is crap. They overcharge you and network is the worst. I hope it closes down. The plans are no longer cheaper. Don't buy. Big no from me.,1
Difficult to cancel,"Phone contract ended so called up to cancel for my mum. Keeping getting transferred. Once got through to someone, they keep trying to convince us to change plans but we have told them many times we just want to cancel the plan. Transferred us again to cancellation consultant. Waited over 30mins. Kept hassling us as to why we want to cancel, said we had to be put on hold for 2mins while they double check the account details. Suddenly disconnected after waiting for more than 10mins. We called them back, again was transferred to cancellation consultation, waiting another 20mins. She asked to speak my mum, mother verified all details. Then she asked why my mother wanted to cancel, with my mum only understand basic English and the vodafone person speaking so fast made it difficult for her to understand even more. I said she can't understand what you're saying so i can speak on her behalf. Was told rudely by the vodafone person that we need a professional interpreter. Like how ridiculous is that. After repeating the question slowly to my mum she says she understands and that she just wants to cancel. After nearly 1 hr dealing with vodafone it took like 1 min to cancel.  Worse customer service. Very rude employees. Their tone of voice is very condescending. Easy to sign up and take your money but cancelling with them, they make you feel so unworthy.",1
Have to go outside and sit in my car to make or receive phone calls,"Using a pre paid mobile provider that uses Vodaphone as their mobile service provider. OMG! The service is NO service like 80% of the time...Absolutely no signal in the house. Have to go outside to make or receive phone calls. If I know someone is calling me, I have to take the call in my car! This service is a disgrace and the TIO/Government needs to start shutting down these rogue telecommunications networks. Not good enough!",1
Very slow internet speed,"Reliable network coverage on my post paid plan,good value for money,havent really used the customer service but the internet is very slow sometimes.",3
Worst experience ever !,"Unreliable, worst customer serviceHad an account with Vodaphone and decided to change to another provider as they offered better rates. I asked for my number to be ported to the other provider. All porting requests have been unsuccessful based on fake reasons like account number not correct, incorrect name,  wrong address, not the right unit on the address ( I made sure all the information was correct, went to a Vodaphone store to double check after each unsuccessful porting)... On the final attempt to port my number  I went to a Vodaphone branch and was on the phone with the new provider who made the porting request while I was there. What shocked me was the fact that the Vodaphone employee intentionally introduced the wrong pin number to access my account and then, when I wanted to check the actual computer screen for accuracy, he kept inputting the wrong pin and was irritated that I asked him to correct it...I only left the store after I made sure everything was confirmed and correctly done. Even after all that the request for porting was reported again unsuccessful again because of incorrect account number...",1
Average,I am an ex Vodafone user and i found that there service is poor and they are not helpful and that it is over priced. You are much better off with a better value for money plan for your phone.,3
Horrendous customer service and network reception,"Vodafone has by far the worst customer service! They are argumentative and rude, particularly the crap supervisors! I called about the reception service and why I only ever get the best of two bars of reception ANYWHERE and when i get home 'No service' I am told literally over the phone that I am a liar! Also, I received a call from a vodafone sales consultant who somehow managed to use a phone contact name from my phone contacts list which I answered thinking it was my family it turned out to be a vodafone consultant trying to change my prepaid contract to an 'updated version' it took him almost two hours to understand my repetitive answer 'No I don't require a new contract' once again he was arguing with me to 'update my contract' he was also condescending. Vodafone STOP being cheap and employing the Indians overseas as customer service they're bad at it !! I have been a vodafone customer for 17years and I will change my service after too many unsatisfactory incidents.",1
What a Joke,"Bligh Park NSW,  1 bar at the best, can't hold any form of phone conversation.  Useless liars.  Do not believe the phone coverage maps.",1
Plans and pro Rata rip off and rude service,I was a long term customer on $80 plan.My plan had expired but Not allowed to downgrade it to a cheaper one until I paid up.Customer service were rude were not interested in all my medical bills just their policy.So I was stuck in higher plan for another month. After I paid the bill they would not pro rata balance. So I am going with another carrier now. They have lost my business.,1
Hiding Cost,"Here comes me again. With that 238$ bill for just 1 month.There is a hissing cost as well, no body told me about this at all.  It supposes to be only 80$ for plan and the phone as the staff said, and now it turns to be 19$ extra for mobile phone and 10 $ for premium service!! What a crap! Why it's now made aware to customers at the first place.I am really angry about Vodafone.I hope it close down right now!",1
Poor Service,"Got two numbers linked, asked to cancel as no network at my home more than 20 times, they cancelled just one and send me bill for 2 months for the other number. once you became costumer then they don't care, Whatever the issue is no adjustments.Highly recommended not to use Vodafone.",1
Crap  service ever used,Crap serviceChanging to 80 red plan and bills added up to 238$!!! With no reason!Highly not recommended to use this Vodafone.,1
Average,The product we bought was tablet.Customer service people are very good and always helpful.Great network coverage with best plan deals,3
No network in my workplace and house,Every day when i walk inside if my house iget no signal in my room in order to call some one i hve to go to balcony or outside of the house......tried calling them but issue is not resolved,1
Save Yourself Time And Money $$$$,"Was a loyal customer for 10 years and there was lack of disclosure on their prepaid plans where they overcharged me up to $600, I curse their business and wish them only the negative things they deserve. I hope they choke on this money that they overcharge people with and rot in hell! Did a bad credit check on me due to refusing to pay horrible over the limit charges. I am on Optus now and they have much better customer experience, policy transparency etc. I am not paid for this review.",1
Not happy at all,"The most lier company I have ever seen,they don't solve problems. They put me in contract with out my knowledge and told me to claim in Investigation form which will take me half of my time",1
How do I give a negative star rating?,Signed up less than a month ago. Promised gold at the time. Told that under 30 day network guarantee we can return/cancel if not satisfied. Poor network coverage only certain area in the house has reception. Called Vodafone after 1.5 week to arrange cancellation but was met with rude billing supervisor. Finally got the approval email to return phone and went to three stores turned out refusing to take the phone back. The original store at Cragieburn Central has the rudest staff ever! Don't go to that store unless you want to be treated like a crap. Called up Vodafone for help and witnessed argument between the store staff and the phone support staff because the store staff refused to take back the phone claiming that they can't process it. The phone support staff resorted to organising a courier to pick it up. I like to thank the help provided by the phone support team but I would not recommend vodafone to anyone after the ordeal that I have gone through. Just a bunch of unpassionate people trying to make a living with no understanding of why their jobs exist!,1
Not Happy Again!,"My phone has stopped working and once again the Frankston store is so unhelpful.  Last time they couldn't/wouldn't help and the guys at Southland Vodafone couldn't do enough for you, great personalities, got it sent off to Samsung and got the problem fixed. Frankston store has told me they couldn't do that as it has a small crack in it, so unable to fix under the warranty, even though the crack has nothing to do with the phone not charging, its been there for a long time, phone has had problems before.  They are very quick to take money but not quick in customer service, they aren't helpful at all.  Not Happy one bit, can't wait until the contract runs out.  Also the data I go through is ridiculous, never before have I used any where near what I do with Vodafone.",1
Appalling,"I live in an inner city area and the coverage is just awful- regardless of whether I am at home or at work. I don't know how this is possible but Vodafone's coverage seems to have gotten worse, not better, over time. I recently upgraded to a new phone and renewed my contract with them and it's the single worst financial error I have made this year.",1
Worst business model ever,"As far as I can see, Vodafone are about confusing people with their offers, and then locking them into contracts. Worst customer service ever, and I am now paying for a phone outright as well as one of their plans which should include a phone. The staff I have spoken too also lie about whatever they can get away with 70% of the time.",1
Tick Tock Now That's A Clock,Vodafonehave provide a cooldeal on several devices now.,5
Stay Away!!!!,I was on contract and had been a loyal customer with them for over 5 years.,2
Terrible service,Really disgusting service of vodafone...we buy wireless earbuds on contract. They send us minimum 8 stores to grab the earphones but still did not get. We call higher authority but they said sorry it's out of stock...what the crap service...why you send us to different stores to waste our time.,1
"Terrible service, stay away","My parents joined up with Vodafone not long ago and have been getting charged extra every single month for data usage. They are elderly people and leave the mobile data off at all times. Once the plan is over, we will not be using these guys. I personally have been using Telstra for many years now and not a single problem.",1
Pathetic! Lack of disclosure while selling the plan!!,"Despite telling the customer rep that I was planning to call Fiji several times before purchasing the plan, he did not nother to mention that Fiji has been removed from the special call listing. So now am paying a monthly bills of $100+ on a $40 plan. Pathetic services. Seems how low they will stoop to get business! Its a disgrace!!",1
8 years with vodafone and now treated like crap,Been with vodafone for 8 years. Decided to get a new iphone 7 plus and called and got told about the plans and signed up to the $60 plan. 3 days later asked if I could change and get on the $80 plan as the monthly cost of the phone is heaps cheaper (wasn't told this cost difference on the phone). Got told I could upgrade but I would continue to pay the higher cost for the phone. I thought my request wasn't too unreasonable as had been a long term customer but they basically would give an inch and said no. At least now letting as many people as possible know that this company just doesn't care and will continue to do so for the next 2 years of my contract. So if you are thinking of signing up look at how they treat a long term customer and think about how they will treat you! Beware!,1
Absolute Shocking,"GOOD JOB VODAFONE... youve lost 4 phone contracts because of your greed.I was with Vodafone for 4years and spent a fair amount of money with them using them as my provider for my business,kids phone and wifes phone.I was forced to cancel my contract a few months early with one of my phones because the connection was shocking and I told them about the connection but said it was fine.3weeks later i chose to disconnect as it was far gone, they begged me to stay and admitted they had a server problem but will be fixed in another 3weeks. I said I couldnt hold on, so i cancelled my contract.
They charged me for disconnection fee of 150$ and I told them it was because of their bad server that forced me to change to another provider but they said thats the polucy and nothing they can do to reduce the fee unless I stay.
It was so stressful dealing with all that hassle with bad connection and Vodafones bad IT service, really rude and during the process the IT team just didnt care even though they admitted their server was down... for 2weeks straight!!
Vodafone has turned into an ugly company.
I told them if they wave the fee I will be back to use them but they said they cant.
Looks like i'm pulling all my phones of vodafone and not renewing contracts with them.
I was liturally forced to move to a better company for that 1 phone because of their server and they told me 3weeks to fix... totally wrong.
TOTALLY DISCUSTING... RUDE AND MONEY GRABBERS.",1
Worst Customer service,"Today Vodaphone called me to improve my services and changing my plan, the quality of the line was bad and the lady another side of the line couldn't hear me and instead of letting me go to work she insists on continuing. Then she starts asking private questions tell me your pin, which countries you are calling to. I told her that I'm in the office and it's not a good time instead she was YELLING at me I told you which country you are calling to.es with Vodaphone in the past 9 years one time they charged me 700$ for 2gb of the internet when my cellular data usage was off then I moved to 3 and I was happy with them.The coverage was limited but it was clear from the beginning what you get. Then three years ago Vodafone bought 3 and I've become Vodafone customer once again I didn't have any problem with them upto now except few 5$ roaming charge when I travel overseas as soon as you turn on your phone you get charged even if you don't call someone or use the internet. Just remember if you get charged now you can use as much as you want.

Overall, I'm happy with their service but the customer service really bad, I've called them few times and I wait in the Que for a long time.",2
I can do nothing from them ripping you off!,"Had signed up a 24 months contract with them. I wasn't too happy with the coverage and customer service so decided to cancel after 24 months but GUESS WHAT!? They don't let you go! I rang at least 3 times talked to 3 different person and all 3 of them said it's been cancelled everything is okay. And now 6 months down the track they sent me a $2000 bill which I am still very upset about. Called them back and explained the situation. Their credit team simply talked over me and said you didn't cancel your contract. I replied ""But I didn't even use your service and I talked to 3 different people to ensure it's cancelled"" He insisted that I have to pay the amount or it will affect my credit history. I am going to consumer affair. Worst experience ever.",1
absolutely garbage service,"The most terrible telecom co in au from my pov. Well, after I emailed almost ten times and called thousands of times just for a cancellation service. Quite simple, quite easy , but a waste of three month. What a great service! I have kept vodafone for almost three years, but literally the most inefficient service support service. If you want to contact someone to deal with ur matters, well, youâ€™ll get the same â€˜answerâ€™ from different people. even if the bill is overdue, they still canâ€™t offer you the best solution. Cause they donâ€™t know either.",1
Worst Insurance Vodafone Is Partnered With!!!!!,"The worst insurance company ever! Infact the worst company ever!! My phone was stolen and we have reported to the police, provided them with the case number but their pathetic customer service people made us feel like we were the thief!! First they declined the claim, spoke to my partner very unprofessionally and then when i opened a second dispute, they accepted the claim but made us feel like they are doing a charity towards us! I have been paying for this service and a company makes their customer feel that way! Next milestone was getting them to dispatch the phone. They say 5-10 working days but dispatched my phone on the 11th day which would be fine if customer service people spoke with some level of compassion or empathy. They have been unbeliveably rude and ignorant. People take insurance to cover their loss but mostly to eliminate inconvenience but this company has no understanding of customer inconvenience. When you are paying them monthly, that would be your sweetest time with them.",1

I have provided a bank statement as proof and they still denying that they received the money claiming the bank didn't release thefunds.However I called my bank to clarify being advise money paid to Vodafone.So I've raised a payment dispute and now they start charging late payment fees and want to send dets collection agency.Total rip offStay away They're scam,1

Rude sales staff - cold calling with No Caller ID,"Someone called into our business today asking for Benita who were our receptionist 13 years ago. Without introducing his name he kept asking me questions such as ""who's authorised person he can talk to"", ""which tele company we are with"", and totally ignoring that fact that he's talking to me, I told him there's no Benita and I won't answer his questions, then I hang up.He called again, asked the same questions, I had to asked him few times for his name and his reason for calling, he just gave me his name as Ted and that he's calling from Vodafone, then again coming back asking same questions above, which after I rejected to answers all of his questions and told him stop calling to our business number, he then called me a miserable woman and hang up. No wonder why Vodafone has been going down so bad, because they hire staffs like this guy.",1

Unreliable signal 4G and NBN,"4G - Regular drop outs in the ACT and VIC, barely a signal between.

Can't even process a simple upgrade,"Tried to do a simple phone upgrade on my existing account only to get e-mails to state my application is incomplete and they need more information (there is nothing included as to what that is).

Vodafone sucks.,"Dear Vodafone,ged my usual monthly amount.

My card declined at the supermarket this morning.. looked on my banking app and my account is overdrawn as the $1400 was debited from account by Vodafone. 

Phone call 3 (Today) - ""I understand your situation Lanah, but we have a process we need to follow, and the money will take 3-4 days to be refunded."", ""we can give you $15 credit in your account for compensation""

Twilight zone,"I live in Perth and had no coverage for 2days. I couldn't receive or make calls, message or use the internet.As I was unable to make a call to vodaphone I went into a VODAPHONE store after work at 6.15pm.  Unwelcoming young lady snatched my phone, rolled her eyes and said after opening the phone...your sim is old.  Replaced it and said its working now.!!t a long story short headed back to the shop which had 5 staff standing around doing absolutely nothing.  I smiled   ""hi wondering if you can help...blah blah the girl said she'd fixed but I still have no access to my provider.  

I past my phone to a young man..he didn't acknowledge me not a word. no smile not even a snear.  Had he heard anything?
Down went his head and he proceeded to tap away at his computer.  10 minutes past...no word from him no explanation....20 minutes ....finaly 25 minutes later I dared to ask politely any luck?

"Don't join, stay away from hassle and from being ripped off","I left Vodafone due to a lot of issue with billing and agreements. There should be a final bill to pay, (obviously the amount is not as it should be) but I am already tired of explaining your staff everything from the beginning every time I call and correct the billing which was so much frustration. Same thing happened at the final bill as well and your staff is agreed to reduce from $90 to $60. They sent message on my phone but didn't send the correct bill. They are still sending $90 bill. I have no access to your site anymore as I port my number to different provider. I looked on your website and my emails but you have no email contact. All coming from noreply@vodafone.com.au 
Either send me the correct bill or send me a confirmation that I have nothing to pay. I just want to pay your remaining amount and stay away from hassle. 
thanks",1
Vodafone made trouble for me financially but I'm still using that,I'm not happy with them because they never helped me but they put default for my credit file for very little money,2
Ignorant customer service,Limited to no connectivity at my home and Vodafone is saying i have to wait without for two months until they fix the coverage in my area. Customer service offered me a discount of $4 a month until they fix the issue. Seriously!!! How stupid they are.,1
The worst customer service ever.,"I have been with Vodafone 6 years. I moved to Optus for few months which provided my company, and tried to return to the Vodafone. When I moved the company plan, Vodafone has my direct debit details, but they didn't draw the money and set me as someone who didn't pay the bill. There was no email or notification about this.So, my application was rejected due to the amount I owed. I called the Vodafone and paid them all and sent an email to them to resume my application. They ignored my email and didn't response at all.her email through the online. There was an notification email which shows the order is processing. After that, i didn't get any further information and called the customer service. They said somehow order was stuck and wait for couple of days. Next day, I visited one of retailer shop and ask them to check my order.

Vodafone has not updated my status, although I paid the whole amount of money I owed. And the order information in their system and my email was not matched. Also, there was a system failure, so the order was not processed and didn't send any notification. The store agent helped me to fix issues and updated information to resolve this issue. However, it was not able to fix the issue and cannot cancel the order. 

Now, Vodafone customer team said that a cancellation ticket has been arise so I need to wait another 1~2 days.
I didn't get the phone yet, and the order information in the website is not the same in my email, and they kept saying just wait. They don't even call me back or send me an email for process. Just asking me to wait and call them back. I spend a whole week to fix this issue.

Don't go to Vodafone, they are not reliable provider and they doesn't try to fix the problems.",1
Worse customer service and they don't care,"I have been with Vodafone from 8 year with 3 services, my phone had some issue and I went to tea tree plaza Vodafone store and was under warranty (2years), been told they couldn't find my purchase in system so suggest to go Apple Store, been Apple Store but they provide only 1 year warranty so same told go to Vodafone, called call centre and again same couldn't find my purchased, asked lists of things to do but still finally same answer....so is this my problem you couldn't find my phone in your system, been 3 different stores more than 15times to rectified my problem. I tried online chanting then and was succeed and guy found the problem and was unbelievable ""didn't update your Purchase in our system"" and sent me to ingle farm store. The guy was good in this store and very help full yes some one after 4 months, yes this was in march and my first complaint was in December. He sent my phone for repair and I got phone call from Vodafone repair and asking for $125 for repair as my warranty Was finish in feb what a joke. It was my problem Your system didn't saw my purchase. It was ridiculous and not any more Vodafone....  so finally see you and good luck Vodafone you loose your 3 account 8year customer.",1
Services of vodafone,I finished my 2 year plan contract with Vodafone on March and i wanted to cancel it coz it was sending me the bill even for the next month (April). I went to the vodafone closer to my place. They gave me the number to cancel the plan. I called them and they told me that it was my last bill and i was okay with that. But i am getting the bill for June as well. And my plan is still not cancelled yet. I am so frustrated with the service. I called and also i went to cancel my plan so many times. Every time they say it might be the last bill. I don't know what should i do now.,1
Worst reception in countryside,"Don't get Vodafone if you go to the countryside or if u are living there, don't get reception, if you are luck can get a bit.",2
After more than 15 years with Vodafone...,"....For them you are just a number that pays the bills. I guess others are similar but you do expect some customer service and respect after so many years putting up with their bad coverage and so on. They tricked me into 2 contract over the phone which supposed to be only one. When I complained about it that Vodaphone offered me 50% cancellation fee. I was left speechless after our last conversation. I complain about the contract that I was drown in to and lady on the other line is explaining to me my last 2 bills. Unbelievable. On top of that sales over the phone was there telesales contractor from India - not even Vodaphone employee. I found out when I complained about 2nd contract that was not explained to me. If was sold to me as one of payment for $30 modem. When I got a bill for 2nd month in the row, then u figure out what happened.",1
Worst phone service provider ever!!!!!!,I have been a Vodafone customer for more than seven years but unfortunately loyalty is not valued at Vodafone. As soon as you sign the contract they no longer care about you just your money. They give you false and misleading information and in the end you are left to folk out the money. Worst provider ever!!!!!,1
An Insult to your Intelligence,"Late 2016 I was charged 4 /  3rd Party text messages which were credited back then I put on a stop & block with the 3rd Party & Vodafone for 4 months nothing then in March 2017 I was charged 136 / 3rd Party text messages I paid it because working long hours I printed out only the first page of the online account. Then in April 2017 I was charged742 text messages at 55 cents each most of them were 1 to 3 seconds apart. Also another 3rd Party charged 10 messages at $9.98 each I tried repeatedly to talk to Vodafone about this for over one month all I was advised was to contact the 3rd Party which I did & a while ago you could talk to a person but now when you call them you get a call centre who will pass on your message the only response I got was a message that Vodafone sent them it read.
Free Msg: 3rd party charges on number ending 221 for entries into Block of cash charged $0.55/ Entry No subscriptions our systems show what your carrier send to us. Now Vodafone is blaming the 3rd party & the 3rd have now ignored my request to talk to them so I contacted the Telecommunication Ombudsman`s office to inform them about Vodafone and The 3rd Party response 3 weeks later Vodafone have an appointed a several case officers who are powerless to help me & the story gets longer with every call I was advised two days ago the 3rd party text messages are at over 2000 and Vodafone does not know what to do now I have cancelled my mobile phones with them with their exit fee`s I will owe Them about $1000 but it is a small fee to pay for your sanity. The investigation against Vodafone & the 3rd Parties is continuing into a possible legal confrontation.",1
Do not take a 24 month contract,So disappointed. I'm paying $90+ pcm my emails are slow and won't open. I keep getting over charged by vodafone and i am still waiting six months later to get my money back. Shop manager misinformed me when selling the samsung promoting its features inaccurately and now I'm stuck with a phone which has had problem after problem. I have been a vodafone customer for 6 + years. I've never complained. Now i have a real problem and they don't want to know. I have spent hours trying to follow this up and unfortunately vodafone have defeated my soul. I have no more polite fight left in me. It's $1000 + to get out of it. Once my q8 months are up i am finished with Vodafone. They disgust me.,1
Misleading Payments,"I've been with Vodaphone since December 2016 and on the same date every month there is money in my account to pay the bill but not once it has been taken out on the correct date, causing me to be ""overdue"" on my payments and it costing me more in the long run. For some it would be no problem but I'm only 18 years of age and money isn't exactly something i can waste on vodaphones poor communication. I'm VERY disgruntled with my contract with vodaphone.",1
Still auto debit and Charge my Credit account for next month service.,"My 2 years contract with them ended on the 10th of May,2017. on the 19th of the same month, we port our service away to optus. on the 22nd, they still auto debit my credit card and charge me another month of service @ $35.18. all Telcos did always 1 month advance billing. why should they argued with me that i don't understand their billing system?  network signal very unstable. on the same house, when i went to my kitchen, signal lost, when on my bedroom only 1 bar. missed a lot of rings when traveled between Melbourne and Sydney. by the way, I used to worked for the Giant telco  here in Australia for 8 years. it's rude for them to tell me, that i don't understand their billing system. Vodafone billing system sucks, ripped customer off. kept away, don't ever get fooled by their low monthly repayment.",1
Worst Telecommunication provider in Australia,"I have been very disappointed with the communication with Vodafone's customers. I have firstly launched a $50 no-locked in contract, lately on my plan has been changed to 12-month locked-in plan without noticing me. All of this is just because one of their tellers called me and promised to give me 2GB free internet data without changing anything, however, they actually canceled my international call and put me into the locked-in contract. When I called their customer care service, the teller told me it is all my fault and even after I explained to them what was happened, the teller still insisted it is my fault and she won't help me to change my plan back to month-to-month plan. From now on, I will suggest all my friends not to use Vodafone's service. Most of the Vodafone users are foreigners who may not know English very well, they take it as an advantage!!",1
"Gers worse and worse in manly , sydney",For the last 4 months the internet in manly provided by Vodafone ranges from very bad to moderate. Last year was good but after I updated my contract the service is very disappointing. I have called the custorem service 5 times and after every call it was ok for 24 hr. Weekends when you need the internet the most are the worse. 4 months ago I was informed that there are some technical issues but come on!!!! What a excuse!!!,2
New Website,"The new website has made it nearly impossible to down load your bill.  This is pathetic!Searching the help system for the way to do this, finally led to a pop-up window asking if I needed an online chat to help.  I said yes, then was asked to type in all my details again (I was logged into my account).  Then was told the online chat was closed!",1
Beware of exit fees,"Just finished our 2 year plan.Now informed will be charged a 50% plus $5 of monthly charge to exit the plan,even though the 2 years are finished.Only carrier I know who does this extra charge.",2
Terrible customer service,The networks coverage is average. I hardly make a complaint but lately been disappointed with customer care. That day call to customer care to activate a sim card for my sister whose is a foreigner. Supposingly foreigner need to go to store to activate the sim as need to show ID so they can activate for you but the customer care try to be smart and tell you different thing. Other day call to check why my bill still show overdue as the payment is already made. But they proposed to me to download the apps so in future I can check your bill. What is a terrible customer care. I am  not sure  is the vodafone call centre locate locally or somewhere out of australia. Sometimes can't even understand what are they saying  with strong accent.  They are totally not experienced and Not listen what customer needs.Always tell you what you already know.  Need to be reconsider whether continue their service.,1
No customer loyalty or competitiveness,"Vodaphone as a company do not provide customer loyalty, no matter what length of time you have been a loyal customer or how many phones you have with them. They are no longer competitive with other providers providing much better data and phone deals, which they are unwilling to match. Keep this up Vodaphone, and everyone will be changing providers. Even your staff can not explain why you can not match your competitors rates. Think, research and compare before re-signing your plan. It's a shame you took over 3 which were a great company and so helpful.",1
Human interaction,"A few years ago their coverage was not very good but I stayed as they were the cheapest.When my son was in hospital overnight, I used alot of data trying to distract him from the discomfort and pain he was in. My bill that month was a few hundred dollars.I rang Vodaphone to arrange for a prepayment plan and Customer Service Officer was very understanding and waived the charges if I continued on a no obligation month by month plan. I would have had great difficulty paying hundreds of dollars whilst on unpaid maternity so it is great to see a big company with heart.
I hope that Vodaphone reads this and continue to allow their staff to exercise compassion when necessary. This is what keeps or brings your customers back and builds a good reputation.",5
Very bad. Misleading contracts!,"I am with Vodaphone on plan, first it is so much more expensive always adding extra amounts !!! The only reason I took Vodafone was I was told by a customer service person that I have a option not to pay for usuage that is $70 per month as I knew I will be travelling overseas. But now that I want that they say no I cannot do that. I can only extend my plan and pay for it after my plan ends plus I have to pay extra service charge!!! And when I said I was told about 3 month he says ""you should ask if there is service charge and everything else"" I mean isn't it your responsibility to let the customer about it??? Veryyyy disappointed!!! Vodafone is a Money sucker!!!",1
"Poor reception, poor customer service.","vodafone is definitely the least reliable network, poor voice reception, cuts out and the data network cannot always be accessed. yes plans are affordable but that is the only customer pull.. price. not clear where they are basing their reliability for the recent australian ads suggesting top notch network coverage. i was a vodafone postpaid customer for 9 years and simply had enough after i wasn't getting coverage at my work place in the melbourne cbd and was told by a customer service rep 'we only ensure coverage at your place of residence... besides its not like you spend majority of your time at work'.. poor response considering the average full time working australian does spend majority of waking time at work and not home. so after that response i changed to a comparable carrier and im happy all round. Also the product reviews that show 5 stars... they must work for vodafone.......",1
"This is rubbish, big fraudulent business","Poor network coverage, knows how to misdirect people and earn money. Very bad customer service. Representatives trying to be too smart. Won't recommend this service to anyone.",1
Very happy,"I am surprised to read all the negative reviews about Vodafone as I have had no issues with reception our customer service which is why I switched from Vodafone prepaid to a sim only 12 month plan. The plans are competitive and you cannot beat Vodafone's $5/day roaming which works like a charm. I'm convinced that if people did their homework in terms of plan inclusions, coverage etc prior to signing up with Vodafone there would be much less negative reviews. Oh yes, it also helps to purchase a plan within your budget and sticking to it instead of complaining about excess charges.",5

MetCentre Vodaphone total rip off,Met Centre charged me $65 for an iphone charger chord and outlet. I found out later that apple sell the same thing for $15. The service was terrible and they had no product information at all. I needed a charge quickly and unfortunately this was the closest store.Terrible,1
Worst network provider in Australia,"Worst network provider i have ever dealt with. Their employees from all departments especially the retention team are the rudest, unprofessional ever. They have no idea about the company policy they're working for and still argue. I would highly discourage getting a plan with this company.",1
I am not being heard and am left with no mobile phone as a consequence,"Despite friendly staff in the Grand central store Toowoomba, I have now effectively been without a viable phone since I purchased a Sony Xperia phone on 8th February. I explained I needed a reliable phone as a woman travelling alone extensively overseas. The battery would not remain charged even over a normal nighttime. The store was good in that they acknowledged the faulty battery and that it was not fit for purpose by replacing it up to three times with another Xperia. In the interim while waiting for replacements I would be without a mobile - about a week each time. I clearly indicated on the second and definitely by the third that I no longer wanted a Sony Xperia as it clearly was not fit for my purpose. I could not have a phone that would have a flat battery in less than a day of travelling. I requested that I be able to instead have a replacement of another in-store brand and pay any difference. Instead all the store will do is continue to offer me a Sony Xperia 4th one now, when I have clearly stated it is not fit for my purpose, I do not want it and I want a simple replacement with another brand. No one out of pocket it is now 2 months and on going. I think I will be a woman travelling alone with no phone. I am not heard and the legal obligations for consumers is not being observed here.

"STORE ASSISTANT PUT FALSE INFORMATION ON MY CREDIT CHECK - EAST VILLAGE, ZETLAND, NSW 2017 STORE","I have just been into the East Village Vodafone Store Zetland to get a new phone on contract.  The male who served me started to fill in my application form and asked me for my current address and how long I had lived there.  I told him 15 months.  He then asked for my previous address.  I couldn't remember the number of the unit block and I  was trying to look it up when he said it didn't matter & to make it up.  I told him it did matter and I needed to find the correct no.  When I looked at the form he was filling in he had put that I lived at my current address for 2 years.  I told him this was incorrect and that he needed to put the information I had given him which was 15 months.  Again he laughed and said it didn't matter.  I told him it did matter as he was about to do a credit check on me, the information would not match.  I then said are you aware that by putting incorrect information it is actually classed as fraud and a criminal offence.  He just laughed again and tried telling me it didn't matter.  At this point I realised this person could not be trusted so I took my ID, got him to delete my details and left the store.   I would have expected a lot more from Vodafone.  If someone from Vodafone would like to contact me to discuss this it would be very much appreciated.

I actually reported this to the TIO and  the Vodafone Resolutions Team got in touch.  The matter has been referred to their fraud team who are going to take this up directly with the store.  I am pleased with the outcome and happy with Vodafone's response.",1
worst experience - pay more than you use,"Please do not take VODAFONE in the contract, this is the big TRAP. These people trap the customers first with telling them you will get free handset with no extra money. Once you sign on the contract, then you are finish. These people always looking for extra money from customers and when customer need some help, they never help to customer and when customer do some delays in the payment or use excess they always jump on the customer head and ROB them.",1
Worse experience with call center,"Staff is very disgraceful with heir answer . Wasting near 1 hour on the phone just to activate the SIM card.end up with ""we are current maintain our service so we can't activate any sim . We are trying to put it up on running in 4 hours. Take me 3 phone call to hear that from a supervisor at Vodafone cl centre. Just hilarious for a simple explaination that all the staff need to honest to their customer with all different answer.",1
Vodafone - World's worst company to deal with,"Absolutely rubbish company to deal with. I request everyone to PLEASE NEVER EVER GO WITH VODAFONE. They will charge you for their own fault and then pass the buck when you ask for assistance. Customer service makes a mistake but you have to pay for it. I wish there was lower than a 1 star rating, as they do not deserve any stars.",1
False Advertising,All the commercials Vodafone do is absolute rubbish the network doesn't at all in Marion Bay and Murray River in South Australia. There is no way the network works anywhere in rural areas in Australia complete false advertising!!!,1
Too much waiting for customer service over the phone,"If you select for a new product service from customer service calling menu, call will be answered within 2 minutes. But if you are after existing product service then you have to wait more than 30 minutes.",1
Horrible Customer service and delivery,"Ordered an iphone which was supposed to be delivered within 2-3 business days its been 6th day nothing received.Can't work without any activate sim card and the staff is horrible in customer service. Talked to Nick from Customer Resolution department, what a bad experience that was. He denied to assist me further.",1
"Vodafone, slow network, lame pricing and generally crap service","Review covers Vodafone in both Australia and NZ. Latest issue. I was with Telstra and was having account issue so ported to Vodafone. Bad mistake. Purchased a $30 SIM and ported in, while the port happened within about 20 minutes, I had no credit so was unable to use the service. After vising store and contacting online help, I was promised it would be done in 4 hours, to no suprise 2 days later it hadn't been resolved so ported out to Aldi (no issues in 2 months) to their credit the store was apologetic but limited to their awful systemI still had a data sim so used it and found the network to be generally unstable.
New Zealand: I used Vodafone while in NZ and the service was terrible. I had horrendous data latency issues, pages would often just time out. major problems with speed and calls drop out all the time with a robotic sound. I paid $40 for about 3GB of data and barely managed to use 300MB in a week despite trying my best. I also had my battery drain badly, I normally make it through the day with 60% with general usage but I would be dead in 8 hours on Vodafone NZ. Their network is seriously broken and bad.",1
"Rude staff at Bourke St Mall, Melbourne","Visited Vodafone store on 31/3/2017. Rude staff at Bourke St Mall, Melbourne. Not helpful and ignorant. Practically treating me as if I am invisible. I am a customer of Vodafone for many years and this is how they are treating their own customers. I am moving away from Vodafone soon! Yay!",1
Good phone but terrible service at shop in Caloundra.,"I went to Vodaphone shop with problem with my 7.  It makes loud noise every hour, and other stuff. The customer service man couldn't have cared less!Very disappointed.",2
No reception and I work at the edge of the city,"You would think that reception might be reasonable as I work at a Melbourne hospital precinct at the edge of the city. The next day at work with the new sim, I was surprised that reception was already down to 1 bar. Inside the building  signal was mostly non-existent or so weak that conversation was garbled. Contacted Vodafone who informed me a planned outage would be fixed in 5 days. However during that time and for that month, reception strength has remained at 1 bar around the building and remains non-existent in my office. Another call to Vodafone escalated it further - "" there will be upgrades happening in the next 2 month"". Vodafone may as well have bots repeating these canned response which are meant to entice you to stay.  Guess what I will be doing to ensure my phone works as it should.",2
Terrible Service,"I spent an hour of my time on vodafone customer service to recharge my daughter's phone and had no luck. My old card that was linked, i do not know how to add a new card. I went on manage my card and i can't even change credit card details. Spoke to customer service as well as the manager in charge they keep asking the same damn questions and in the end with no success. Worst customer service experience.. Hence why we will need to go to Optus, my younger daughter has already moved to optus coz we keep on experiencing the same thing all the time.",1
Vj4300,"To all those out there I am too experiencing the shocking service of Vodaphone lies, false information, false promises and poor quality service a 3 week old telephone Samsung S7 now sits in its box by my bed as its unable to be used now thanks to the lies that Vodaphone told me before purchasing this product.To all those Unhappy Vodaphone customers I've googled a website that actually allows you to contact the Executives Of Vodaphone Australia Direct, I'd highly recommend it ..http://www.vodaphone.com.au/about/executiveI've written directly to the Complaints Executive from Vodaphone as its listed on that website : ) if he gets enough Complaints there going to have to look at it. Good Luck to you all!!",1
Vj4300,Hello just thought I'd let everyone know Vodaphone representative rang me about 1hr ago and they've decided that my contact is too be removed and my phone will be sent back to Vodaphone and I ll be reimbursed for any outstanding costs .. I'm Very Happy to say I'm no longer a Vodaphone Customer !! From what I was told this is all thanks to the Telecommunications Obudsmen and there investigator team : )) good luck to you all .. Cam,1
"Terrible, after sale, excellent when you buy something from them","My Pocket Wifi device was not working after a while. They said that I should take it to the shop to replace. I took it, they said that they should write it on your account. I called them, they said that they will write it down on the account and I can go to them tomorrow. I went there again and they said that they should send it for repair and I have to be with no wifi for a week.cess will be. 

What I do now is to change my provider and when I am with the new provider, I will give them the device to repair and after the repair, just give it away and never think of this company again.

April 23rd, 2017 Update: Please read this before buying anything from this provider.

Hi, 

",1
Excellent service,"Extremely satisfied,different customer service experience, immediate solution, friendly staff, huge variety to choose from.I will recommend everyone to get the network",5
Riiiiiipppp off,Your deals are not competitive and truly a massive rip off. I've been with you for over 5 years and screw me. What a rip off its been. Good riddance woot woooooot!,1
Fraudulent charges to my account.  Vodafone refuse to recind,"I have been with Vodafone for years.  Always paid on time, never gone over the amount of my data.  In December Vodafone sent me an account for over $900.  Later it went to $1000 (even after the account had been closed down).along with the costs to replace my business signs and brochures after having to change my phone number when they froze my business phone.  

Bullying tactics to make me pay a fictitious bill

I wonder how many other people have crumbled and paid in order to stop the bullying....",1
"Thieves, Deception, Misrepresentation = VODAFONE","Ladies and gentlemen,g, I will be taking this to the telecommunications ombudsman, but I just wanted to warn the public. 
In summary, to save your time and money avoid Vodafone like it has the plague or you're going to get screwed around and left with the foulest of tastes in your mouth",1
Horrible customer service,"Called the customers service twice and they sounded so rude with their high pitch voice. Like seriously, it was supposed to be me who should be annoyed since they asked me to pay another $40 for my monthly billing. Like why should I pay another $40 if I've already made the payment in the past few days??They kept asking me to call my bank why the money hasn't received yet and I did call my bank, she (bank cust service) told me that the payment has already been made and it was because vodafone hasn't finalized yet. The ridiculous thing was, vodafone has successfully direct debited my money and refunded it again and blaming me for the late payment. Ok, I was being easy on that case. I made the payment manually from their website and it was already stated on my bank statement. The customer service staffs on Vodafone kept saying that they're pretty sure the $40 hasn't left my bank account. Lol, like seriously, I can check my money on my internet banking account and I'm 10000% sure my $40 has been sent to your company even my bank was sure about it.
I've been using vodafone for almost 3 years now but once my plan is done, I'll burn the bridge.
Thanks Vodafone, you've lost one of your customers.",1
Terrible service and told me if i buy this phone id walk out with it all set up ready to go,"Customer service terrible , vodaphone forest hill Victoria promisises things they cant do , constant reassurances beforesigning the contract and then when signed all of a sudden i get a sorfy sir we cant do this , that or actually anything . But now youve digned it we no longer care !!Stay away from vodaphone there a joke ..",1
Terrible service and told me if i buy this phone id walk out with it all set up ready to go,"Spoke to Vodaphone service department called me on the 21-3-17 and was told that due to my poor experience ive suffered through vodaphone they have offered me a massive $5 reduction off my phone bill every month , wow how exciting , this is what other clients/customers can experience when vodaphone promise what they cant deliver ..
Wait theres more ive still gotta try and chase up a vodaphone store that can arrange my phone to what it should of been and its also costing me time off work and fuel to drive around and try and correct there mistakes .. ive gone to e different vodaphone stores and walked away frustrated again and again ..",1
Terrible service and told me if i buy this phone id walk out with it all set up ready to go,"For all those out there frustrated at what to do call the Telecommications Ombudsmen and lodge a complaint , they will generally write a letter on your behalf asking them ( vodaphone ) to contact me within 10days in which they have and nothing has been resolved other than a $5 reduction of my phone bill every month .. 
I rang the Ombudsmen on the same day letting them know what vodaphone had offered and now the Ombudsmen will investigate further .. will post the outcome when I know more :)",1
Terrible service and told me if i buy this phone id walk out with it all set up ready to go,"Everyone will be happy to know the ombudsman went into fight on my behalf and the phone has been sent back and I've had no further costs .. if you too are suffering the nonsense I suffered , highly recommend Telecommunications Obudsman they are absolutely brilliant..",1
HORRIBLE!,"Bought a brand new samsung s7 edge. It shocked me when I answered while it was plugged into charge. Vodafone are refusing to accept a return and have basically told me its my fault that  the ""device safety states it should not be used while charging"" ARE THEY SERIOUS ? Saumsung? is this what you do to your customers? Iv had an iphone for years never ever have I been shocked while using it when it was plugged into charge! VERY VERY DISAPPOINTED!",1
AWFUL!!!,"When my plan ended, I called up vodafone to go pre-paid, I thought i was for months, then I suddenly received an email about a payment for a debt collection company on behalf of vodafone, I called them up and enquired about this issue and apparently i was on a put on a post-paid plan that i was unaware of, I have always made payments, never missed ONE! They never contacted me nor tried to call me about this issue, the bill was $60 and now I owe the debt collection company $90 for vodafones mistakes, horrible listening skills and customer service and if i do not make this payment i receive a bad credit history for 5 years, 5 years for THEIR MISTAKES, yet it states on this on their website ""If an account remains unpaid for a period which we deem to be significant, Vodafone will make several attempts to contact the customer."" Like i mentioned, we are never ever contacted about this nor do I deem one $60 unpaid bill significant compared to 6 years of good payment history. 

My family and I were loyal customer for over 6 years, NOT ANYMORE!!!! Goodbye vodafone.",1
Fraud/crap/unacceptable behaviours,"Dear sir/Madam,I am writing to let you that I have terrible experience with Vodafone 7 month before I got plan which iPhone 5s plan I supposed to pay $50 every month but Vodafone franchise told me I will give more data if you pay extra $10 I signed contract but when I activated my SIM card I got call from Vodafone as you can checking recording as well on a same day he called me he was pushing me to take tablet and extra SIM card I denied 8 Sha /9 time and I confirmed. From him I am not going to get any tablet or extra sim he said no and then when I got bill on first month it was with extra charges since may till now I sent almost 35 fraud forms as customer team told me to submit this form and I am the one who was calling to pay my remaining bill which was $60 but they first wait for fraud team then we will fix I was confirming them you are not going to deactive my service they confirmed to many time no I sent my form to credit an@vodafone .com.au but no answers

Network Coverage Guarantee FAIL,"I signed up under the 30 day Network Coverage Guarantee as the estate I live in has only ever been able to receive Telstra mobile coverage. The Vodafone Network Coverage map showed that I should receive 4G coverage where I live. Upon taking the mobile phone home and turning it on, it would only display SOS and one bar of reception intermittently. I returned the mobile phone to the Vodafone store and was advised the phone plan would be cancelled and no charges would be deducted from my account. Almost 2 months later a charge for $95.99 was deducted (which equates to the monthly plan charge). After spending almost an hour tonight I have been able to resolve this with Vodafone and was advised the charge would be refunded to my bank account. It's disappointing however that a) their Network Coverage map is not accurate and b) that I have wasted a lot of time firstly signing up in-store, bringing the phone home to trial, returning it to the store, and finally having to chase a charge that should never have been deducted from my account. Very disappointing and a waste of my time.",1
Crap crap crap,Vodafone used to be a top company! Until all the sudden i can't get a decent reception in my own home and can't connect to my internet. Even my 3G data was so slow that i couldn't load anything up! This entity has gone down hill... And i won't be renewing that is for sure.,2
Rude customer service,I find this company disgusting. Very disappointed with the call back I received from a very rude & stuck up lady. Not helpful at all & was just trying to find excuses. How can I average on 26 Gb of data a month than move my plan up to 46Gb & go over and my bill was $300 ?? Not using extra internet the same amount I watch & now going over way over??? 10 years I've been with Vodafone & they are pathetic how they handled my enquire & complaint..,1
Horrible provider,"This is the first time in my life I face such a horrible operator. Random drop from 4G to 3G in areas like road in the middle of covered zone, no Internet while this happens! Vodafone support explained me on my complaint on why I do not have Internet and provided screenshot that this is because I am on 3G!!! I work in telecom, but even people who don't know that 3G service include Internet!!! Even 2G network provided very slow but access to Internet.Random lags with me not being able to call some numbers while we 3 meters apart and both have at least 1-2 bars in reception indicator. Sometimes I receive scam SMSs from ""Woolworth"" and other companies with a winning of 100-150 AUD gift card and URL to click. When I called to Vodafone to complain I was told that SMS did not go via Vodafone network! Amazing! It came to my phone via cosmic rays?! I asked to move my wife's number under my name and Vodafone instead of doing it completely blocked any service including calls, sms and Internet for 16 hours! Almost everyone who answers the call on 1555 are unprofessional, have heavy accent and rarely use brain to process information. They simply follow the script they have on their screens.
Very often I get a call from Private Number and someone say they are Vodafone and ask me for online PIN to access my profile and update me on reported issue. Like kids. If you want me to provide you an information that potentially can lead to hacking into my account you should at least call from Vodafone number that has record in White Pages. 
So many bugs and lags with MyVodafone application. Unexplained automatic charges for extra data, which I do not need as I had 500Mb+ left and was not using it.
Multiple times I was given a false information as explanation on my questions. Its like being a teacher at a school. I have to explain the basics of mobile networking! 
Not mentioning a very bad coverage and complete ignore on suggestions to improve it in some areas. Only promises that ""We constantly working on network improvement"". I have no doubt they do, but very slow and only where it is extremely bad not to have cover.",1
So bad service,You lost customer your service so bad. I paid off my phone on the plane and some jerk put me on crap plan which I can't call overseas so I try to cancel it but your personal so stupid they take ages to do that.,1
All they want is money! Don't care about their customers at all!,"I've been with vodafone since I was in High school - Usually about 4months before my contract ends, they will contact me and ask if I want to renew my contract, and get a new phone, this year they didn't. Went into store, told them I want to go to a sim only contract, with only 1month left in my previous contract. Was told that's all alright, I'm now actually on a higher contract, just without the phone set, and I'll only be charged $40 for my new contract. Comes the billing day, and surprise surprise, vodafone is charging me for my previous contract's remaining phone $$!!! Seriously vodafone??? Stop telling different stories!!! Why is it that I can have a new handset FOUR MONTHS in advance, without having to pay off the previous one, and now I do??? 

NOT HAPPY AT ALL!!! This contract is only 12 months, no reason for me to stay with vodafone after this now.",1
Very annoyed,"After being with Vodafone for almost 8 to 9 years. You have now lost a very loyal customer. I have never been so annoyed and a very long time. Let the story begin right last year June 2016, I signed up for a contract as I do every two years wow my plan was for $70 a month I added on $6 for 60 Minutes international calling and $20 for 3 gigabytes so in total that cost $95 anyway I was always going over my international minutes so that was an extra $5 for 60 Minutes slowly going up to $106 or $110. Well anyway February 2017 they send me an email saying I qualify to take $100 mymix which allows me $1,000 international calling and 20 gigabytes a month why did they offer this to me in the first place I would have saved so much money. I am done with Vodafone. And I'm still arguing with them.",1
Vodafone and their lies,"I was behind on my repayments yes (but never used the service as I had a mental breakdown, due to a separation and other issues, however I settled the account in full, bill + costs etc. I WAS reassured that within 72 hrs. my services would be restored, Waited waited, only to find they had locked out number for ever, so all my clients, 30yrs etc have now lost contact with me. I am 67 Yrs old and this treatment has left me devastated.These people SUCK big time. and noticed that my calls drop out with frequent regularity, even when the phone is placed on a firm surface, unmoved, how can someone take your money and offer such bad service in return is beyond me. Rang customer service they agreed that there was a lack of coverage, yet the Kangaroos on the side road, enjoy a better 3 to 4 bar coverage to my 1. Haven't seen a roo with a phone yet. more like 1917.",1
You have lost a customer!!!,Every time I recharge my credit the next two days they send me a message that it expired! I don't call anyone or use my internet outside. This is terrible when I used to recharge it used to last months but now 2 days Vodafone you have lost a customer and you're going to lose a lot because I'm not the only one complaining. Do something about it before you lose many customers. honestly this is terrible!,1
Service is absolutely terrible!,"I called up to add a hand set onto my contract, I was told yes, I then called up the next day to confirm & was told yes again. So I went into my local store & was told yes so I did, when I received my next bill it was for nearly $1,000 and was charged for my outstanding balance & put on a new plan. I have been a loyal customer for over 6 years. I called up over 10 times to ask why I was lied to & I was so annoyed by how pathetic their customer service is. I was then told I needed to pay it all in 2 weeks & when the 2 weeks was up I did not pay it all & then my service was disconnected. Outrages by thier shocking service, so I am now with Optus!",1
Great sale and awful customer service,"I really don't appreciate this new corporate model that companies like Vodafone just concentrate on sells and no after sale support. They literally don't care about you after on boarding. It is like you sit in airplane and nobody provide you any service anymore!!!he account at all (of course I used it for calling Vodafone)
2- I have wasted 45 minutes of my time talking with customer service.
3- I have to spend at least 20 minutes to write this review.
4- I have to complain to Vodafone Compliments and Complaints. (1 hour)
5- I have to lodge a complain to  Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO)  (1 hour)

"Terrible, think twice before you enter......","i went in to Vodafone Store to pay a/c, using my credit card, here's what they say, they need to take my card information, and in front of them were two payWave eftpos machine....  So I ask why they need to do that, there is 2 eftpos machines on the counter?   They said they have to take my card information , otherwise I can go to the post office and pay there, and it will cost me more.....  Be alert...... Do not release your personal a/c details to no one.....",1
They dont even deserve a 1 star,"Join you up for wrong plan. Cut down my on my gigs for no reason and then now took 4Gigs in one hour. LEGIT do not join VODAFONE!!! disgusting customer service and all they try to do is upgrade your plan and scam you of your money. Not even exaggerating, 3 ombudsmen cases in 14 months. RUN AWAY!! dont make the mistake i did!",1
No value for money,"Recently their plans are neither competitive nor value for money. Regarding the data usage, we get notification only after exceeding the data limit, what is the point... terrible!",1
Bad Service,"Not happy with Vodafone once again, as they never send reminder emails when they are processing your bill and refuse to do anything about it. Not only do they overcharge per month but their customer service is very poor. Won't be going with this company again.",1
Disgusting,Vodafone have Disgusting service ever. I won't recommend anyone! They will charge you without giving you complete information.,1
Feeling so helpless,I have an overdue amount and i called to sort out something to solve the problem but talking with them felt like i am so helpless. I asked for the supervisor but they are so reluctant to pass the line. I don't know why.Disgusted by their behaviour. This is what i get after using vodaphone for 4 years.,1
So disorganised,I live in Perth and I change my plan to other provider and I cancelled my Vodafone plan but they still do prepaid for me and pick up $70 I can't understand why they are so disorganised,1
Worst Customer Service,I had to wait 28 minutes to get a customer service team member to change my plane  and he wasn't good enough to provide me information.,1
Awful awful awful!,"Coverage is almost non-existant even in city areas, connection drops constantly and web pages take the same time dial up Internet use to. SMS messages can sometimes take a day or more to finally send, they barrage you with constant 'upgrade' opportunities which are entirely useless.The staff have heard so many complaints it's made customer service reps bitter.As stated above an awful provider, they should be ashamed of themselves.",1
Do not trust the sales operators!,"I was informed by the sales operator that he could match the online offer and give me an extra small discount if I organise my phone plan with him. I only received half the Qantas Frequently flyer points. Not the amount stated in the online offer. I called up and after a half hour wait, I was informed the balance would follow. Still nothing. What a bunch of liars.",2
Exellent Service both at point of sale and with telephone enquiries.,"Customer service was brilliant at Vodafone at their  highpoint outlet, i had just had an unpleasent experiance at the Virgin outlet so it was great to see the bright side of customer service. After exerything was explained to me including the extent of coverage i agreed to a post paid plan including the handset. The guy serving me set everything up and assisted in transfering all my stuff from my existing mobile to the new one. Coverage has been uninterupted so all in all a great service, well done Vodafone.",5
Worst Customer Service Ever,If i could give them zero stars then I would! Been trying to upgrade my plan but they seemed to have not offered any help! Worst company ever!,1
WARNING -Don't Use Vodaphone Postpaid,This company is the most incompetent provider I have ever used.Their service is non existent. Phones are unreliable dont last long and need replacing.Connectivity is a disaster you are constantly cut off from phone call system and the Internet.They constantly overcharge you and don't do what they say they do. Poor service poor communication. Case Managers have nil investigation skillsGo to the Ombudsman.,1
Worst service ever.,These people have the worst customer service EVER! Departments have no idea about the issues of the others. I called FOUR times to resolve a bill i already had paid! I will be cancelling my service!,1
They are disgusting,"The day i signed my contract with Vodafone and the sony experia phone was the begining of my troubles. The phone managed to break down three times within the first two months. and VODAFONE WERE EXTREMELY UNHELPFUL DURING THE WHOLE PROCESS. AT ONE POINT THE STORE MANAGER IN BROADMEADOWS INSTRUCTED ME to leave the store and NOT COME BACK if the phoen broke again from no fault of my own. tHEY FINALLY GAVE ME an Huawei phone even though I was left with weeks not being able to use my phone and refused to allow me to end my contract. Now a year later i have had a very unusual problem where i have not been able to receive phone calls from people i could previously receive from. When others were trying to call me they would always redirect to another man's number who was on the Optus network, not on Vodafone. It has been about 3 weeks with Vodafone denying it is a problem on their end, even after changing the sim, checking all phones involved to see if settings were changed on my phone and other phones involved, resetting my phone, testing my sim in another phone, calling other people's service/network providers, and Vodafone staff saying they could not fix the problem, I have now had a new phone number given to me, and Vodafone has not compensated me for not being able to use my phone correctly for 3 weeks even though I have been paying $83 a month for their service. I don't understand how they can get away with charging people for a service that is not working. Today, I was given my new number and told it would be 3 hours to receive notification that the new number is activated and it has been 9 hours and I still have not heard anything.I cannot wait for my contract to end, I have had nothing but trouble dealing with them. It is a shoddy service with slick advertising. If I could give less than one star I would.

"Horrible coverage, Untrust service","I signed up for Vodafone and decided to change my mind after 3 days so i called the customer service, they said i could not change or i have to pay 24 months plan to get out. then i saw the add said 30 days change of mind. they are so dishonest just to keep customer",1
Absolutely Horrible,"The service is absolutely horrible. We had one simple issue that took 4 calls to get sorted, and the 4th person was surprised that it hadn't be done yet. We then had issues with coverage everywhere in Adelaide, their coverage map would show coverage but yet still it would not actually work. We then got told that it was right and we just had to deal with it. We ended up having to take it to the TIO to actually even get someone who would actually listen to the issue, that person let us out of the contract but it shouldn't have had to come to that for basic help.",1
Vodafone has been great,I have been with vodafone all of my mobile life and although had the odd issue and network coverage issue but other than that i have never really had a problem. I am however moving over to Telstra for their apple music deal but would happily go back to Vodafone in a heartbeat.,4
Scammed,"Just paid $100 to Vodafone AU to have a number reactivated, only to later be informed by the same people that it could not be done after all. We reported this but Vodafone absolutely refuses to admit that they made contradictory statements overnight and have effectively scammed us of a number that has been associated with its user for 10 years and is still linked to important documents and accounts. Because it was removed without prior warning to us. Vodafone's telephone operators call this policy but it is nothing short of daylight robbery. Thanks for nothing, you've just lost 4 long time customers but it's not like that's too big a deal for a hotshot phone company like you",1
I hate vodafone forever.,I have a postpaid plan with an ipad in a contract. They charged me around &260 dollars just to change the plan from $50 to $30 per month as i was traveling overseas. I have not even used any service for a month and still i have to pay $400 for nothing. Im not at all satisfied with their services. You are for no good!,1
Worse than useless.,Vodafone don't ring back when they say they willVodafone don't provide efficient service (in fact they don't provide any service at all)Vodafone don't record notes on your telephone calls to them forcing yourself to explain multiple times the same problem without resultsVodafone don't talk between departments so the left hand is not aware of what the right hand is doing and vice versaVodafone deserves the nickname VodaFAIL!!!,1
5 years since last use and they still suck,"Not only the worst phone company I've had dealings with, but perhaps the worst business I've had dealings with. My experience was at Vodafone Shop, Midland Gate in WA. The general attitude of the staff when I walked in was that is it was too much effort to get up and help someone. There was no one else in the shop at the time. I eventually got served by a young gentleman. When he did finally get up and serve me it was with a completely ""couldn't care less"" attitude. I was after a pre-paid mobile broadband dongle. I needed the dongle as it was required to connect to a DLink N300 3G/4G router, which I had researched, and it it should have worked with. There were even instructions available on setting it up with Vodafone. I purchased a Vodafone Huawei 3G broadband dongle along with $50 prepaid recharge. Got it home and got it working on my laptop. The network was so slow that it was unusable. It failed to work on the N300 router at all. I took it back about 2 hours later for a refund and again the same ""couldn't care less"" attitude. I was given a customer service number to call and told to call them. In the shop they looked up my coverage area said it should be OK and basically said ""we don't care and we are not interested in refunding you"". I showed them that my tethering on my $49 3G smartphone on the Telstra network far outdid what their network achieved. 

Was disgusted at Vodafone, and went across to Optus, They were helpful and friendly. I got a 4G dongle and it works out of the box. No issues. So happy that I'm going to look at getting a plan with them. I would have gone with Telstra but they didn't have the dongles.

It's been 5 years since I last used Vodafone. I left then because they sucked but thought I would give them a try again because they have been advertising that they have improved. 5 years on however, their service and network still suck and are probably worse than ever.",1
Just save yourself the hassle and go elsewhere,"I made a huge mistake getting a contract with Vodafone.  3 months down the line, I am still regretting and felt strongly enough to post a warning to the general public.ember,  I only actually received 1 week's free coverage
- multitude of issues experienced in December resulting in the loss of the ability to make or receive calls over the Christmas holidays
- issues continued in January with lack of coverage in and around Perth

Network coverage is appaling but really the most frustrating thing is calling into the call center.  There's almost always a minimum 5 to 10 minutes wait to get to speak to someone, and when you do finally get through, it's  someone from a call center in India who can only stick to their script.  They only have a set number of responses and will sometimes repeat the same sentence 3 or 4 times on the conversation.  If the area you called can't help, there is usually another 5 to 10 minute wait to speak to someone else in another department.

Also, once you sign up with them, it's all locked in - no way out despite the service and coverage issues.  This is one company that really does not care about it's customer, it's lack of service and reputation as a whole.",1
Horrible Service,"Be careful with contracts they charged me after the 24 months was up and told me I had to tell someone to end the service before hand without any notice to do so. When speaking with customer service the worker got emotional and I had to repeat myself several times before she understood what I was saying eventually she told me the complaint service will contact me in 48 working hours which never happened so no problems were solved and still the service had not been cancelled. Finally rang up after the 48 hours a final time talked to another worker that explained that even though they didn't send a notification to let me know to end the service it was still my fault for not knowing when to end it then I was transferred to another department and she cancelled my service. The last worker was quite efficient the rest were useless.
Network is okay they go out sometimes but send a condolence message I've been with Vodafone for 10 years so this all truly sucked now I'm changing to Virgin. 
I did post paid never had a late bill yet still gave me attitude, over talked me, became condescending, told me ""I'm not a liar"".
Honestly the service is good as long as you never have to speak to anyone over the phone they make it especially hard and explain it to you as you are the fault. Just read your contract don't listen to what they are selling write down dates and put up reminders. Won't be dealing with Vodafone again.

June 9th 2017 Update: Was with Vodafone for 10 years :(

I have used vodafone for well over 10 years. Through adolescence into adulthood. Last two years I was on a plan. Overall the service is great of course because I used the damn network for a long while. Anyways. I'm at the end of my contract. Cool I can get me a new phone. Even more awesome. Except I received a monthly bill. So okay I'll pay this one call them up and see what's happening. Call them up hey I thought my contract has ended. They're like yeah it has but you can use it up to so and so date. I'm like thanks and I won't get billed after so and so date. They reply yes man. So everything is cool until I get another bill. Um no! I call up again explain I've been billed ask what's up. They say you know you have to end the contract verbally over the phone or in store. I say isn't that what I called up last time for. They say because I continued to use the phone after that so and so date they decided to extend my contract. No I didn't. Anyways I had this huge argument with vodafone customer service. I was called a liar. Had a worker ask me if I was sure I remember calling them. Talked over before completing me sentence. I never cancelled the contract. I'm too hostile. Got bounced around through different departments until I got to the last lady. At this point I'm exhausted and crying these people want to charge me an extra $70 because the first person I talked to didn't end my stupid contract. So I ask the lady please end the contract I'm leaving vodafone. Period. She tries to say I need to put money into the account so the number doesn't go dead. I'm thinking I don't care and no I'm not staying with this company but say can you just end the contract double check my last payment has and will be the absolute last payment you'll get from me and bye... VODAFONE sucks. Customer service is poor. Value for money no tried to charge me extra. Twice.",1
They deny coverage issues,"Consistently contacting vodafone saying i have coverage issues especially in my own house and they say according to their data there is no problem. I know its vodafones fault as its been a problem since day 1 of when my girlfriend and i both started a new cheaper plan. Since then I've got a brand new phone and still same problems. I keep calling, vodafone keeps denying any problems. My internet cuts out all the time and calls won't ring. I've seen a coverage map at my local vodafone store and there is a blackspot starting from my next door neighbours house. This could easily extend to me yet vodafone keep denying it. I've called up about 5 times, each time the info i provide isn't recorded or passed on and i need to keep re explaining my problem.",1
Vodafail,Network coverage is appalling in any modern buildings. Expect to have to make multiple calls to complete a conversation. They will tell you that there is good coverage at a location. Don't believe the marketing.,1
Vodafone Is Biggest Robber In The Australia,"Vodafone Is Biggest Robber In The Australiacheated by VODAFONE AUSTRALIA.

Never take these connections, there are other service providers which they are offering unlimited local, national and international calls to the countries like LYCA, BOOST and LEBERA for $29.99 only and vodafone giving the same services and charging $100 per month.

Poor service,"This company needs to have a close look at themselves. Poor service and the worst network coverage, no signal in the Sydney CBD. When you raise the issue with them they don't even care. Spoke to a manager in the call centre, his response was to say nothing until I hung up. Absolutely disgusting!",1
Being ripped off,"I am on a red shared plan with my partner have been on plan for about 1 year and it's cost us a fortune, we were  better off on prepaid.  Have been really good customers have rang customer service to see if they were able to find us a better plan as the one we were put on we found wasn't suitable.  We are getting hammered an extra $200-300 a month because of the extra data charged outside data in the monthly plan (1gb $10) have rung Vodafone numerous times to ask if they can give us more data and exchange international minutes as we don't use it.  They have been very unhelpful and then have the nerve to ring me and say don't forget to pay my bill.  Sorry to say but you've just lost a good loyal customer.  Word of advice if your not going to look after your loyal customers then don't expect them to hang around much longer.  All I wanted was your customer service to find a better and suitable plan for us.",1
dreadful customer service,"I have a prepaid account and have just wasted $40 on a combo credit, don't purchase this -  it is advertised as providing 90 min of international calls which is wrong, it won't allow me to make a single international call as it says I have insufficient funds, vodafone refuse to help as I don't have a four digit pin I have had this account for nearly 4 years this is the first time I have had this problem but I am dismayed at the total waste of my money and time as there is no effort on their part to help me without a magical 4 digits which I was never given and certainly never set",1
Worst.,"Very disapoonting , they refused to give me a phone becuase i have two month less visa, since i am in Australia i am with vodafone , paying my bills on time but they made me very disapoont , my friends are commected with optus and they never ask for visa and stuff but vodafone is making it more complicated, and i am not going be with vodafone anymore, after i finish with this contract i m going to say bye to vodafone and also will tell my friends to not go foe vodafone",1
Don't ever sign up to Vodafone received a 2.3k phone bill saying I have used 306g of data.  Not poss,Absolutely bull of a company. I rarely use my phone and apparently in 1 month I have used 2.3k worth of data. Everyone is cancelling their plans with Vodafone and because of that they are over over charging their regular customers. They are going bankrupt and trying to bring in the money where they can. This sort of thing has also happened to my mother and husband. No one listens and the only explanation I got is 'you must have used it' because they are such a powerful company they use their authority to make people pay they bully you till you crack. Currently supposedly I owe them $7268 for a 24 month contract that I cancelled a year ago.  Massive bullies and if I don't pay I will have to go to jail.  This is not OK. Don't fall into the trap that so many of us have.,1
The worst company,The dealer misguided me to sign the contract. The company pass the buck and did not solve the problem. Therefore I got huge amount unfair charge. They keep charging during the argument. They are money hunger. I think Vodafone is the worst company. I won't use Vodafone for my life.,1
Vodafone Highpoint city store manager,"Highpoint vodafone store manager is a real nightmare! Not willing to help a customer put a screen protector just because it wasn't from their store! Every other product is, but the screen protector! How discussing and unprofessional can you get love? Clearly you need more customer service training!",1
Terrible and Unethial,Service Sucks - Very rude staff - Referred to the TIo - VODAFAIL COME BACK - We should restart this,1
Mobile data charges,"Replaced old Vodafone with a Smart Mini 7 - Balance of around $30+, almost immediately dropped down to $12.38 when I had only made one call and sent one text.  On checking usage I found that after installing my Prepaid SIM card from old mobile to new one that there was a charge of $17 plus for PKT data usage.  It continued to charge every few minutes charging a couple of cents each time until I contacted Vodafone and they advised me to check if the 'mobile data' was turned on, if so I could turn it off.  To cut a long story short the 'mobile data' on my new phone was turned on and it appears that it was automatically downloading updates. I am very disappointed that this happened as I did not turn the 'mobile data' on on my phone and I lost a lot of my credit. On checking my 92 old Mother's usage I found that she had lost over $25 with the same thing and there is no way she would have turned on 'mobile data'. On the positive side - as a family of three seniors who use Vodafone's 365 prepaid on our phones, in case of emergency, we have been very happy for a number of years.",1
Mobile data charges,My review on 15 Jan 2017 only had a 1 star rating - would have put zero if I could have.  My second review on 5 November 2017 had a 5 star rating.  I assumed the second product review would come up as a separate review.  The 5 star rating on my initial review is VERY MISLEADING!,1
We've added 1GB of data for you to use for just $10.,How pathetic!! Who gave you the right to automatically charge me $10 without my permission. Is this just in Australia or are we all being ripped off around the world?,1
Extremely disappointing and a waste of money,"Vodafone: In my time of using Vodafone I lost at least $500 as they over charged for extra data. I tried fixing the issue as I called up vodafones help line, but all that happened was they tried to sell me more then hung up on me. The customer service is terrible and no help. I would not suggest using vodafone unless you want to loose money. I'm disgusted with Vodafone.",1
Falsely charged over 10 years after disconnecting mobile service.,"We had two mobiles with Vodafone that were disconnected over 10 years ago. Since then I have had no dealings with Vodafone- no mobile services.c.) I explained someone was falsely charging my credit card and we didn't have any services with them- I was told to go into a Vodafone store and it could all be sorted. I went in to a Vodafone store and the manager couldn't help me, he couldn't find any services related to me. He advised me to block Vodafone from charging my card. My bank said the only way to do that was to cancel the credit card- which I did. My bank also reversed the two charges by Vodafone.

December 2016 I received a letter of demand from Vodafone- threatening legal action, sending debt collectors and reporting us as bad creditors. My wife received a call (on our home phone) and discovered the charges are related to a mobile number she held 10+ years ago. I reported the problem to the TIO.

Vodafone contacted me and I got the same response/ run around- I asked for an itemised bill to be sent but they refused. They wanted a Fraud Declaration signed which we were happy to do, but we couldn't sign it without the dates the charges were made against my wife's old number. I forwarded them a third party authorisation document in order for them to send out the charging details- a huge mistake as they still refused to give me the details of when the charges were put against that old number (and I'd just given more personal information to a company that clearly has major issues with security and personal information like credit card details.)

Raj is the person who has been harassing us. Vodafone is so dodgy. They'll happily send out a letter of demand- but then refuse to send any itemised details of what the charges are related to.

Raj called this morning and Vodafone have magically decided to waive the charges- but that doesn't in anyway compensate me for the amount of stress they have caused. He hung up on me in the middle of me informing him what an incompetent company Vodafone is.",1
Vodafone is good at deceiving international students,"When I arrive in Melbourne, my husband and I went to a branch store of Vodafone in Clayton station in Melbourne and asked a monthly plan, but a sales person told us to have a 12-month contract and explained every good thing about this plan. We asked about what if we stop the plan, he told us that the exit fee is 12$. After discussing for a while, we decided to buy 2 numbers with 12-months contracts. We signed on papers he gave us and he told us that he would send us an email about the plan, but we received an email 2 days after we signed the contract. That is why we didn't know that he deceived us and gave the wrong information in the first place.

2 months ago, we transferred our numbers to a different provider, and was expecting an early exit fee of 24$, however, we have recently received a bill for 270$. Apparently, the early exit fee was 12$ per month for the rest of the months of the contract. I contacted Vodafone and explained the situation, and they said that they couldn't do anything about that and would charge me this amount. 

This is a total fraud of Vodafone for international students.",1
Bad coverage and customer support,"Coverage us still bad, even in metro areas. Fast customer support but it feels like you're talking to a machine and unhelpful most of the time. Plans keep changing. Constant disconnection of data.",1

Vodafone Destroyed my Holiday.,"Without Prejudice and in my opinion:We have been with Vodafone for a number of years always pay our account and this happened: On Boxing day 2016, I discovered that my phone didn't work. I was on holidaysI contacted Vodafone and was told no barring, no problems and that I should go into a vodafone store. I was in Gerroa, I had to go to Nowra or Shell harbourOn a 39 degree day, We travelled 30 klms to Nowra and found no store. I had no internet and ended up going to Shell harbour another 50 klms. Then only to be told that my account was barred. They said they had sent a reminder, they didn't, I had the Shell harbour person look at my phone, and he agreed no reminder, They said the account was 5 days late (Christmas public holiday). (I paid on the spot) I can not start to tell you how much damage this did to my holiday and how extremely disappointed I am in being treated like this. 

I have spoken to a manager at Vodafone and he stated that I was not barred although I saw on the Vodafone computer the word barred. We pay our accounts and to be barred whilst in a country area (during Christmas break) for an account that was a few days overdue This behaviour and incorrect communication was unconscionable and shows that they have no Christian morals.

We are contacting the ombudsman and looking for financial compensation for the damages done 
We will cancel our accounts as they fall due and will be making sure your readers see what they are about.

Shocking customer service,"I was with Vodafone for couple of years back in NZ and never wanted to use this provide again.Moved to Australia and my wife got a 24 months contract with phone, took 4 months to cancel the roaming which we did ask to be turned off in the shop and online and ended up paying $50 because we received couple of calls while we were overseas.We had $15 extra for mobile insurance and when mobile had an issue, we were told that we had to pay $130 access fee for an issue that a repair shop fixed it for $75. (read the terms and condition and never trust the dodgy sales person)
We called twice and asked them to cancel the mobile insurance, 11 months later, they are still charging us and every single time we call,we  get a horrible service from the call center.
From my experience working in a call center for 4 years, it seems that nobody doing any KPIs for the call center and staff are getting away with not logging the calls or screwing customers over and over again and if you get lucky and talk to their supervisor, they are rude and arrogant and leave you at the other side, your problem in the middle and themselves staying on the other side. 
Original plan that we signed up was $60 per month which we never ended up paying $60, instead the least we paid was $80 per month, last invoice, $130, Data is off most of the time while we are not at home but somehow we go 4G over the limit each month and good luck explaining that to the support team,they treat you like a dumb.I can't wait till Feb to cancel this contract.
Dodgy sales people and not caring call centers.
Shame on government that doesn't do anything to control Telecommunication.",1
Worst customer service. Never fix your problem,I requested to change my contact number from postpaid to prepaid and was been told that will take 24 hours and am trying to contact them they are just transferring my call to different but not fixing my problem since 2 days.,1
No data anywhere.,"Was touring when i bought a Vodafone sim card for use in Tasmania and the coverage was terrible when the salesperson said it was excellent. What an outrageous lie! When I needed to call emergency 24 hour services, to use my data for work or to check for directions, the Vodafone 4G will ALWAYS fail you. Never going to use Vodafone again.",1
They are rude (bleep),"I've actually been a customer for 8 years and have often defended them. Especially during the Vodafail years. I then actually had an issue on there new COMBO packet. It says I have 50 international texts. But every time I try and send a international Text with an image it says I don't have enough credit. Never used to have this issue before they change the structure of the COMBO package.umber of checks with someone who was trying to get rid of me and then got transferred to a specialist. His first words to me ""I hear you can't send international texts that must be very traumatic for you"", In the most sarcastic tone. I've never been treated like that by a customer service anywhere. Its just plain rude. He again tried to get rid of me. Ensuring me that nothing is wrong with Vodafone. 

Basically they are just plain rude and don't give a (bleep) about you. 

An of course the issue hasn't been solved.",1
Read the Terms and Conditions,"Unlike me are you aware that if you buy a mobile phone outright from a Vodaphone shop you actually are buying a locked phone and if that phone is more than 6 months old you will have to pay $25 to have it unlocked.. $50 if less than 6 months old..be aware this is not widely publicised and certainly wasn't explained when I bought the phone, buy the same phone from Coles, Woolworths etc. not locked.

6year happy customer.,"Signed up on 24month contract on dec'2010 and renewed on Dec'12 and again on Dec'14.Its been 6 years with vodafone, love the service and customer support.

Am not planning to renew on this price anymore,Shopping around looking for better deals. I cant see any better alternative,The one better to vodafone is Telstra which is not so economical.....i think i will end up going for a sim only plan to keep the costs down.
 I am sorry to see many customers not happy with vodafone in terms of coverage and customer service....",5
"What a crock, absolutely terrible postpaid service!","After being a loyal (mostly happy or at least content) prepaid customer I decided to sign up to postpaid. After working in sales and retentions with another provider for numerous years, I agreed to the verbal / digital contract expecting to have been fully informed... Oh was I wrong!Having absolutely no choice in the matter when it comes to data add-on's is absolutely ludicrous! I can't just turn off my data, I need it for work! Now thanks to the staff at Vodafone (Vodafone switch in Australia excluded), I'm left with a huge $1000+ debit.

Mixed bag,"My overall experience with Vodafone has been OK. A few hurdles at the beginning but I haven't had any issues since then. When I first signed up, I was not accepted for cover because of my credit history. I paid to get a credit check done by the same agency they use and it came back 100% clean. The staff at the store couldn't tell me why and I have up after 30 minutes on hold to the call centre.d phone support. The Vodafone app is functional. They let us upgrade mid contract which was a bonus. 

All in all i am satisfied but it's nothing to write home about, will happily jump ship for a better price at the end of my contract",3

Apon entering the store, I was greated by a female Shop Attendent. I asked her for a copy of the invoices, as Vodafone had failed to send them. I was fobbed off and redirected to another store employee. This male Shop Attendent then approaches me and refused to comply with a simple serviced requestm stating store policy.

Stay away,I have been with Vodafone the past 4 months and the last week has been the worst I have experienced from any other company but this one they disconnect my whole service including the loss of my number because I was 3 weeks behind in my bill owing $166.80 when I had rang them several times to discuss this matter I explained my financial situation I'm a single mum with 2 children and was willing to pay $100 there and then to at least get my service back on but that wasn't good enough the greedy people wanted the whole $66.80 for my service to be put on then I organise a date to pay the whole amount then they disconnected my service and number completely after 4 days after everything was organised for me to pay the full amount the following day after the full disconnecting so I rang them back up and wanted out of the contract because they arnt for filling there part of the contract and also no compassion what so ever I explained I'm doing it tough at the moment trying to give my boys a Christmas and this was the last thing I need and they did not care one bit Which brought me to tears over this I'm so upset to even think about it now that they can do this to me right near Christmas,1
Great service,"I've been with Vodafone for 2 months and haven't had any problems. They were very helpful from start to finish, helping me chose a package which suited my requirements, transferring my mobile phone number from the previous provider and then taking me through everything to make sure I understood it all. I wasn't rushed, pressured or forced into anything. Thank you Amanda for all your help.",4

Deceiving assurance.,"Seriously VODAFONE, your Customer Service is very disappointing/lousy! You kept putting me on hold, transferred my call to different departments, and the ending?  No solution!!! Do not give assurance to your customer if it is not true! That is deceiving! And GREAT JOB Customer Service! MY 1hr and 20mins (to be exact) was just wasted!!!",2
They want us to move to other providers!!,"I've been with vodafone for 12 years, recently I requested to go on a lesser data deal, and they responded with go to another provider, we don't have less data. So that's what I'm doing. If vodafone think I'm too small for them, then their head is way too big for who they are, they won't last long with that belief!",1
so ridiculous customer service from store,"I have been running with vodafone almost 8 years but I have experienced today was terrible with the store(Altona gate shopping center) customer service, who that lady serve she was very rude. I went to ask for the sim plan and she just handed to me plan paper and without any explanation further I have never seen this type service in any store. I was taken about the 12 months plan but I have changed my mind after her behavior. In addition i just ask for my payment date she gave reply like "" DON""T YOU KNOW?"". oh my god that's so ridiculous. She should learn customer service. I am also working with clients i never make them unhappy.",1
Below average,"Vodafone's extremely cheap, now I know why. Terrible network reliability and speeds, probably one of the worst websites I've ever used, it's always down for maintenance. Value for money is ok, customer service is decent for anything non technical (account problems, online payment issues ect). Reception is terrible, an average of 1 to 2 bars maximum on 4G (3 to 4 bars with telstras 4G). I've been with Vodafone for over 10 years with no problems, but since using my phone for more online activities, Vodafone's flaws have become really apparent. Save yourself some time and hassle, pay a bit extra and go for telstra.",2
Poor customer service and tend to charge more and more if they see any possibility,I reduced my plan to$22 from $35 thinking it would be cheap because I didn't use my mobile data much but without any warning they are  charging me$296.I called customer service and told them it was my mistake and I didn't know that change in plan would cost money. They should have given me the first chance of warned me through email or anything.What the hell is wrong with them ? I am really disappointed with their customer service.Charge up to $50 or 100 would be ok but I have to pay them almost $300 for only reducing my plan to $22. Is the customers money have no value.We have to work hard for many days to earn that money and they are charging almost $300 for only reducing the plan to $22 from $35. I can't say their service is not good but they are overbilling the customers if they see a small chance or possibility just like in my case.Also their customer service is also poor.If they would have given warning when changing a plan by emailing or through phone I wouldn't have changed my plan.I am really really disappointed.,1

Extremely Terrible Customer Service at Westfield Liverpool store 2nd floor,"I had to get my address changed (same as on my driving license) on Vodafone system and I didn't know my PIN code. I personally visited Vodafone store located on 2nd floor (I think next to best & less) westfield liverpool sydney shopping center. A customer service representative (girl) asked for my ID and I showed her my NSW driving license then she checked in the system and told me my PIN number and asked me to go and call vodafone customer service to get the address changed as she was not willing to help me any further. I said why can't you change my address now? she replied we can not change addresses here as we don't have much access to the system and only by calling customer service you are able to get your address changed. She disputed with me for more than 15 minutes but didn't change my address. Then I said okay I want to talk to your store manager. Another customer service person (male) came and started argument like why do u want to get ur address changed now etc. I said to him loudly that I need to talk to ur manager and every single customer in the store heard me saying this. Finally store manager (medium height guy with golden beard) popped in as I guess he was dealing with other customers and he double checked my details on my driving license and change the adsress in max 10 seconds and I'm damn sure he was on same screen. I was surprised that how easy it was and those 2 people were not willing to help and wasted bloody 15 - 20 minutes.
Absolutely Pathetic Customer Service.
