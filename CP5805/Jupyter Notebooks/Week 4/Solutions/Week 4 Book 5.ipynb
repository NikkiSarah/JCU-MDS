    "## Files in Python\n",
    "Remember that to open a file in Python we say:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<variable_name> = open(<file_name>, <mode>)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "*variable_name* will be the name we use in code to refer to the file, *file_name* is the name of the file on the computer, and *mode* will typically be:\n",
    "- 'r' for read\n",
    "- 'w' for write\n",
    "- 'a' for append\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file does not exist when it is opened then the mode dictates the result:\n",
    "- read mode - the program will throw a *FileNotFoundError* exception\n",
    "- write/append mode - the file is created, and opened\n",
    "\n",
    "If the file *does* exist then write and append behave differently:\n",
    "- write mode - empties the file and prepares to write into the empty file\n",
    "- append mode - leaves the current data in the file and prepares to write new things at the end of the file\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done with a file you need to close it with:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "<variable_name>.close()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing to files\n",
    "Once a file is open in write or append mode we can print to it, the same way we would to the screen. There are two things to keep in mind:\n",
    "1. Things will look the same in the file as they do on the screen. Spaces, commas, formatting, everything.\n",
    "2. Everything to be printed to a file *must* be a string. Numbers must be typecast using str().\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statement will print to the screen:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "while *this* statement will print to a file:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\", file=<file_variable_name>)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "## Reading from files\n",
    "There are a few ways to read from a file. We will practice the most common ones here. Remember we can:\n",
    "- read the *whole* file into a string using read(),\n",
    "- read a single line into a string using readline(), or\n",
    "- read the *whole* file, into a *list* of strings using readlines() - (each line is its own string)\n",
    "\n",
    "These approaches are useful when processing parts of a file, or the whole file at once. Often we will need to process the entire file, line by line. This can be done in a loop, using either readline() or readlines(), but we can also use a for loop to iterate *directly over the file*. **When we use a loop we do not need to use *readline()* or any other reading method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember** - everything read in from a file is a string. If want numbers, you *must* typecast them using int() or float().\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code creates a file containing 5 numbers, then displays it to the screen. Enter and run it to see this in action:\n",
    "```python\n",
