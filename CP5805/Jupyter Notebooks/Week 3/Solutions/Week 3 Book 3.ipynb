    "We will structure all our Python programs to contain a main function, which is the start of our program. Other functions will be added as needed. Remeber that to use functions we must define them, and then use (call) them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def functionName():\n",
    "   function body\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "some examples:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def getValue(prompt):\n",
    "    value = int(input(prompt))\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "\n",
    "def getAsCurrency(value):\n",
    "    return(\"$\" + '.2f'.format(value))\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling:\n",
    "To use a function we use its name. If inputs are needed we pass the appropriate number of arguments, and if the function contains a return statement then the call is assigned to a local variable using the assignment operator (=)\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#define main\n",
    "def main():\n",
    "    price = getValue(\"Enter the price: \")\n",
    "    print(\"The price you entered was\", getAsCurrency(price))\n",

    "\n",
    "You also need to write the main() function, which will ask the user for the distance and fuel consumption rate, pass those values to the function above and then display the result to the screen."
