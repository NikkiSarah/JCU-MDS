      "\n",
      "Anne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. Initially, she wrote \n",
      "it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the \n",
      "Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast from Fondon that after the \n",
      "war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people \n",
      "under the German occupation, which could be made available to the public. As an \n",
      "example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Impressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the war was over she would \n",
      "publish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and editing her diary, \n",
      "improving on the text, omitting passages she didn't think were interesting enough and \n",
      "adding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her original diary. In the \n",
      "scholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne's first, \n",
      "unedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited \n",
      "diary, which is known as version b. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last entry in Anne's diary is dated August 1, 1944. On August 4, 1944, the eight \n",
      "people hiding in the Secret Annex were arrested. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, the two \n",
      "secretaries working in the building, found Anne's diaries strewn allover the floor. ,Miep \n",
      "Gies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it \n",
      "became clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread, to Anne's father, Otto \n",
      "Frank. \n",
      "\n",
      "After long deliberation, Otto Frank decided to fulfill his daughter's wish and publish \n",
      "her diary. He selected material from versions a and b, editing them into a shorter \n",
      "version later referred to as version c. Readers all over the world know this as The \n",
      "Diary of a fauna Girl. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In making his choice, Otto Frank had to bear several points in mind. To begin with, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "the book had to be kept short so that it would fit in with a series put out by the \n",
      "Dutch publisher. In addition, several passages dealing with Anne's sexuality were \n",
      "omitted; at the time of the diary's initial publication, in 1947, it was not customary to \n",
      "write openly about sex, and certainly not in books for young adults. Out of respect for \n",
      "the dead, Otto Frank also omitted a number of unflattering passages about his wife and \n",
      "the other residents of the Secret Annex. Anne Frank, who was thirteen when she \n",
      "began her diary and fifteen when she was forced to stop, wrote without reserve about \n",
      "her likes and dislikes. \n",
      "\n",
      "When Otto Frank died in 1980, he willed his daughter's manuscripts to the Netherlands \n",
      "State Institute for War Documentation in Amsterdam. Because the authenticity of the \n",
      "diary had been challenged ever since its publication, the Institute for War \n",
      "Documentation ordered a thorough investigation. Once the diary was proved, beyond a \n",
      "shadow of a doubt, to be genuine, it was published in its entirety, along with the \n",
      "results of an exhaustive study. The Critical Edition contains not only versions a, band \n",
      "c, but also articles on the background of the Frank family, the circumstances \n",
      "surrounding their arrest and deportation, and the examination into Anne's handwriting, \n",
      "the document and the materials used. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Anne Frank— Fonds (Anne Frank Foundation) in Basel (Switzerland),, which as \n",
      "Otto Frank's sole heir had also inherited his daughter's copyrights, then decided to \n",
      "have anew, expanded edition of the diary published for general readers. This new \n",
      "edition in no way affects the integrity of the old one originally edited by Otto Frank, \n",
      "which brought the diary and its message to millions of people. The task of compthng \n",
      "the expanded edition was given to the writer and translator Mirjam Pressler. Otto \n",
      "Frank's original selection has now been supplemented with passages from Anne's a and \n",
      "b versions. Mirjam Pressler's definitive edition, approved by the Anne Frank— Fonds, \n",
      "contains approximately 30 percent more material and is intended to give the reader \n",
      "more insight into the world of Anne Frank. \n",
      "\n",
      "In writing her second version (b), Anne invented pseudonyms for the people who \n",
      "would appear in her book. She initially wanted to call herself Anne Aulis, and later \n",
      "Anne Robin. Otto Frank opted to call his family by their own names and to follow \n",
      "Anne's wishes with regard to the others. Over the years, the identity of the people \n",
      "who helped the family in the Secret Annex has become common knowledge. In this \n",

      "to be. All other persons are named in accordance with the pseudonyms in The Critical \n",

      "screaming, and if Lies doesn't look after her, Mrs. Goslar starts screaming. So Lies \n",
      "has a hard time doing her homework, and as long as that's the case, the tutoring she's \n",
      "been getting won't help much. The Goslar household is really a sight. Mrs. Goslar's \n",

      "while later Margot appeared in the kitchen doorway looking very agitated. \"Father has \n",
      "received a call-up notice from the SS,\" she whispered. \"Mother has gone to see Mr. \n",
      "van Daan\" (Mr. van Daan is Father's business partner and a good friend.) \n",
      "\n",
      "I was stunned. A call-up: everyone knows what that means. Visions of concentration \n",

      "fate? \"Of course he's not going,\" declared Margot as we waited for Mother in the \n",
      "living room. \"Mother's gone to Mr. van Daan to ask whether we can move to our \n",
      "hiding place tomorrow. The van Daans are going with us. There will be seven of us \n",
      "altogether.\" Silence. We couldn't speak. The thought of Father off visiting someone in \n",
      "the Jewish Hospital and completely unaware of what was happening, the long wait for \n",
      "Mother, the heat, the suspense — all this reduced us to silence. \n",

      "\n",
      "\"Don't open the door!\" exclaimed Margot to stop me. But it wasn't necessary, since \n",
      "we heard Mother and Mr. van Daan downstairs talking to Hello, and then the two of \n",
      "them came inside and shut the door behind them. Every time the bell rang, either \n",
      "Margot or I had to tiptoe downstairs to see if it was Father, and we didn't let anyone \n",
      "else in. Margot and I were sent from the room, as Mr. van Daan wanted to talk to \n",
      "Mother alone. \n",
      "\n",
      "When she and I were sitting in our bedroom, Margot told me that the call-up was not \n",
      "for Father, but for her. At this second shock, I began to cry. Margot is sixteen — \n",
      "apparently they want to send girls her age away on their own. But thank goodness she \n",
      "won't be going; Mother had said so herself, which must be what Father had meant \n",
      "when he talked to me about our going into hiding. Hiding. . . where would we hide? In \n",
      "the city? In the country? In a house? In a shack? When, where, how. . . ? These \n",
      "were questions I wasn't allowed to ask, but they still kept running through my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Margot and I started packing our most important belongings into a schoolbag. The first \n",
      "thing I stuck in was this diary, and then curlers, handkerchiefs, schoolbooks, a comb \n",
      "and some old letters. Preoccupied by the thought of going into hiding, I stuck the \n",
      "craziest things in the bag, but I'm not sorry. Memories mean more to me than \n",
      "dresses. \n",
      "\n",
      "Father finally came hQme around five o'clock, and we called Mr. Kleiman to ask if he \n",
      "could come by that evening. Mr. van Daan left and went to get Miep. Miep arrived and \n",
      "promised to return later that night, taking with her a bag full of shoes, dresses, \n",
      "jackets, underwear and stockings. After that it was quiet in our apartment; none of us \n",
      "felt like eating. It was still hot, and everything was very strange. \n",
      "\n",
      "We had rented our big upstairs room to a Mr. Goldschmidt, a divorced man in his \n",
      "thirties, who apparently had nothing to do that evening, since despite all our polite \n",
      "hints he hung around until ten o'clock. \n",
      "\n",
      "Miep and Jan Gies came at eleven. Miep, who's worked for Father's company since \n",
      "1933, has become a close friend, and so has her husband Jan. Once again, shoes, \n",
      "stockings, books and underwear disappeared into Miep's bag and Jan's deep pockets. At \n",
      "eleven-thirty they too disappeared. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was exhausted, and even though I knew it'd be my last night in my own bed, I fell \n",
      "asleep right away and didn't wake up until Mother called me at five-thirty the next \n",
      "morning. Fortunately, it wasn't as hot as Sunday; a warm rain fell throughout the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The four of us were wrapped in so many layers of clothes it looked as if we were \n",
      "going off to spend the night in a refrigerator, and all that just so we could take more \n",
      "clothes with us. No Jew in our situation would dare leave the house with a suitcase \n",
      "full of clothes. I was wearing two undershirts, three pairs of underpants, a dress, and \n",
      "over that a skirt, a jacket, a raincoat, two pairs of stockings, heavy shoes, a cap, a \n",
      "scarf and lots more. I was suffocating even before we left the house, but no one \n",
      "bothered to ask me how I felt. \n",
      "\n",
      "Margot stuffed her schoolbag with schoolbooks, went to get her bicycle and, with Miep \n",
      "leading the way, rode off into the great unknown. At any rate, that's how I thought of \n",
      "it, since I still didn't know where our hiding place was. \n",
      "\n",
      "At seven-thirty we too closed the door behind us; Moortje, my cat, was the only \n",
      "living creature I said good-bye to. According to a note we left for Mr. Goldschmidt, \n",
      "she was to be taken to the neighbors, who would give her a good home. \n",
      "\n",
      "The stripped beds, the breakfast things on the table, the pound of meat for the cat in \n",
      "the kitchen — all of these created the impression that we'd left in a hurry. But we \n",
      "weren't interested in impressions. We just wanted to get out of there, to get away and \n",
      "reach our destination in safety. Nothing else mattered. \n",

      "Dearest Kitty, \n",
      "\n",
      "So there we were, Father, Mother and I, walking in the pouring rain, each of us with \n",
      "a schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of \n",
      "items. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave us sympathetic looks; \n",
      "you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn't offer us some kind of \n",
      "transportation; the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only when we were walking down the street did Father and Mother reveal, little by \n",
      "little, what the plan was. For months we'd been moving as much of our furniture and \n",
      "apparel out of the apartment as we could. It was agreed that we'd go into hiding on \n",
      "July 16. Because of Margot's call-up notice, the plan had to be moved up ten days, \n",
      "which meant we'd have to make do with less orderly rooms. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hiding place was located in Father's office building. That's a little hard for \n",
      "outsiders to understand, so I'll explain. Father didn't have a lot of people working in \n",
      "his office, just Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman, Miep and a twenty— three— year— old typist \n",
      "named Bep Voskuijl, all of whom were informed of our coming. Mr. Voskuijl, Bep's \n",
      "father, works in the warehouse, along with two assistants, none of whom were told \n",
      "anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a description of the building. The large warehouse on the ground floor is used \n",
      "as a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several different sections, such as \n",
      "the stockroom and the milling room, where cinnamon, cloves and a pepper substitute \n",
      "are ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next to the warehouse doors is another outside' door, a separate entrance to the \n",
      "office. Just inside the office door is a second door, and beyond that a stairway. At the \n",
      "top of the stairs is another door, with a frosted window on which the word \"Office\" is \n",
      "written in black letters. This is the big front office — very large, very light and \n",
      "very full. Bep, Miep and Mr. Kleiman work there during the day. After passing through \n",
      "an alcove containing a safe, a wardrobe and a big supply cupboard, you come to the \n",
      "small, dark, stuffy back office. This used to be shared by Mr. Kugler and Mr. van \n",
      "Daan, but now Mr. Kugler is its only occupant. Mr. Kugler's office can also be reached \n",
      "from the hallway, but only through a glass door that can be opened from the inside \n",
      "but not easily from the outside. If you leave Mr. Kugler's office and proceed through \n",
      "the long, narrow hallway past the coal bin and go up four steps, you find yourself in \n",
      "the private office, the showpiece of the entire building. Elegant mahogany furniture, a \n",
      "linoleum floor covered with throw rugs, a radio, a fancy lamp, everything first class. \n",
      "Next door is a spacious kitchen with a hot-water heater and two gas burners, and \n",
      "beside that a bathroom. That's the second floor. \n",
      "\n",
      "A wooden staircase leads from the downstairs hallway to the third floor. At the top of \n",
      "the stairs is a landing, with doors on either side. The door on the left takes you up to \n",
      "the spice storage area, attic and loft in the front part of the house. A typically Dutch, \n",
      "very steep, ankle-twisting flight of stairs also runs from the front part of the house \n",
      "to another door opening onto the street. \n",
      "\n",
      "The door to the right of the landing leads to the \"Secret Annex\" at the back ofthe \n",
      "house. No one would ever suspect there were so many rooms behind that plain gray \n",
      "door. There's just one small step in front of the door, and then you're inside. Straight \n",
      "ahead of you is a steep flight of stairs. To the left is a narrow hallway opening onto \n",
      "a room that serves as the Frank family's living \n",

      "\n",
      "Of course, it's very difficult for Peter, who gets caught in the middle, but no one \n",

      "phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it came. Today he's walking around with a \n",
      "heavy scarf on because he's got a stiff neck. His Highness has been complaining of \n",

      "\n",
      "Mother and Mrs. van Daan aren't getting along very well. There are enough reasons \n",
      "for the friction. To give you one small example, Mrs. van D. has removed all but \n",
      "three of her sheets from our communal linen closet. She's assuming that Mother's can \n",

      "she thinks, since they're packed in cardboard boxes in the attic, behind a load of \n",
      "Opekta advertising material. As long as we're in hiding, the plates will remain out of \n",

      "other books. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, Mrs. van Daan, Mother Said, there's a big difference between Margot and \n",

      "at the appointed place at the appointed time. Mr. Kleiman went up to him, announced \n",

      "were upstairs, just above his head. When Miep told him, he was so astonished he \n",
      "nearly fainted. Thank goodness she didn't leave him in suspense any longer, but \n",
      "brought him upstairs. Mr. Dussel sank into a chair and stared at us in dumbstruck \n",

      "were neatly grouped around the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars \n",
      "had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, \n",
      "there could be very serious repercus sions. So Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat \n",
      "and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter \n",
      "(armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies \n",
      "(including Margot and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes \n",

      "Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no \n",
      "exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and I'd always found \n",
      "them so comforting. Number two: Mr. Voskuijlleft early last night, and we weren't \n",
      "sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that was of little importance now. The night had just begun, and we still weren't \n",
      "sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that between \n",

      "eight-fifteen — when the burglar had first entered the building and put our lives in \n",
      "\n",
      "jeopardy, and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we thought about it, the \n",

      "\n",
      "Ode to My Fountain Pen \n",
      "In Memoriam \n",
      "\n",
      "My fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions; I valued it highly, \n",
      "especially because it had a thick nib, and I can only write neatly with thick nibs. It \n",
      "has led a long and interesting fountain-pen life, which I will summarize below. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was nine, my fountain pen (packed in cotton) arrived as a \"sample of no \n",
      "commercial value\" all the way from Aachen, where my grandmother (the kindly donor) \n",
      "used to live. I lay in bed with the flu, while the February winds howled around the \n",
      "apartment house. This splendid fountain pen came in a red leather case, and I showed \n",
      "it to my girlfriends the first chance I got. Me, Anne Frank, the proud owner of a \n",
      "fountain pen. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was ten, I was allowed to take the pen to school, and to my surprise, the \n",
      "teacher even let me write with it. When I was eleven, however, my treasure had to \n",
      "be tucked away again, because my sixth-grade teacher allowed us to use only school \n",
      "pens and inkpots. When I was twelve, I started at the Jewish Fyceum and my fountain \n",
      "pen was given a new case in honor of the occasion. Not only did it have room for a \n",
      "pencil, it also had a zipper, which was much more impressive. When I was thirteen, \n",
      "the fountain pen went with me to the Annex, and together we've raced through \n",
      "countless diaries and compositions. I'd turned fourteen and my fountain pen was \n",
      "enjoying the last year of its life with me when . . . \n",
      "\n",
      "It was just after five on Friday afternoon. I came out of my room and was about to \n",
      "sit down at the table to write when I was roughly pushed to one side to make room \n",
      "for Margot and Father, who wanted to practice their Latin. The fountain pen remained \n",
      "unused on the table, while its owner, sighing, was forced to make do with a very tiny \n",
      "corner of the table, where she began rubbing beans. That's how we remove mold from \n",
      "the beans and restore them to their original state. At a quarter to six I swept the \n",
      "floor, dumped the dirt into a news paper, along with the rotten beans, and tossed it \n",
      "into the stove. A giant flame shot up, and I thought it was wonderful that the stove, \n",
      "which had been gasping its last breath, had made such a miraculous recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All was quiet again. The Latin students had left, and I sat down at the table to pick \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "up where I'd left off. But no matter where I looked, my fountain pen was nowhere in \n",
      "sight. I took another look. Margot looked, Mother looked, Father looked, Dussel looked. \n",
      "But it had vanished. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Maybe it fell in the stove, along with the beans!\" Margot suggested. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"No, it couldn't have!\" I replied. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that evening, when my fountain pen still hadn't turned up, we all assumed it had \n",
      "been burned, especially because celluloid is highly inflammable. Our darkest fears were \n",
      "confirmed the next day when Father went to empty the stove and discovered the clip, \n",
      "used to fasten it to a pocket, among the ashes. Not a trace of the gold nib was left. \n",
      "\"It must have melted into stone,\" Father conjectured. \n",

      "Without her, the cooking and shopping will be very difficult, not to mention how much \n",

      "or Mrs. van Daan. We all noticed it. This went on for a few days, and then Mother \n",
      "took the opportunity to warn him about Mrs. van D., who could make life miserable \n",
      "for him. Dussel said Mr. van Daan had started the silent treatment and he had no \n",
      "intention of breaking it. I should explain that yesterday was November 16, the first \n",

      "\n",
      "I can say without exaggeration that Dussel has definitely got a screw loose. We often \n",

      "a good example and be a person I can respect, but in most matters she's an example \n",
      "of what not to do. I have the feeling that Margot thinks so differently about these \n",

      "rushed to my eyes, and Margot and Mother began laughing at me. I was so furious \n",
      "that I stuck my tongue out at them, right there on the street. A little old lady \n",

      "must have cried for hours. Strangely enough, even though Mother has wounded me \n",

      "Sally. For a long time we went everywhere together, but aside from that, my love was \n",
      "unrequited until Peter crossed my path. I had an out-and-out crush on him. He liked \n",
      "me too, and we were inseparable for one whole summer. I can still see us walking \n",
      "hand in hand through our neighborhood, Peter in a white cotton suit and me in a short \n",
      "summer dress. At the end of the summer vacation he went to the seventh grade at \n",
      "the middle school, while I was in the sixth grade at the grammar school. He'd pick me \n",
      "up on the way home, or I'd pick him up. Peter was the ideal boy: tall, good-looking \n",
      "and slender, with a serious, quiet and intelligent face. He had dark hair, beautiful \n",

      "class were in love with me. I enjoyed it and felt honored by their attentions, but that \n",

      "was strictly necessary, something he'd never have done otherwise. But I got my \n",
      "chance in the afternoon. Since I felt like spoiling Margot on her birthday, I went to \n",
      "get the coffee, and after that the potatoes. When I came to Peter's room, he \n",
      "immediately took his papers off the stairs, and I asked if I should close the trapdoor \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "to the attic. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure,\" he said, \"go ahead. When you're ready to come back down, just knock and I'll \n",
      "open it for you.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I thanked him, went upstairs and spent at least ten minutes searching around in the \n",
      "barrel for the smallest potatoes. My back started aching, and the attic was cold. \n",
      "Naturally, I didn't bother to knock but opened the trap-door myself. But he obligingly \n",
      "got up and took the pan out of my hands. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I did my best, but I couldn't find any smaller ones.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Did you look in the big barrel?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Yes, I've been through them all.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "By this time I was at the bottom of the stairs, and he examined the pan of potatoes \n",
      "he was still holding. \"Oh, but these are fine,\" he said, and added, as I took the pan \n",
      "from him, \"My compliments!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "As he said this, he gave me such a warm, tender look that I started glowing inside. I \n",
      "could tell he wanted to please me, but since he couldn't make a long complimentary \n",
      "speech, he said everything with his eyes. I understood him so well and was very \n",
      "grateful. It still makes me happy to think back to those words and that look! \n",
      "\n",
      "When I went downstairs, Mother said she needed more potatoes, this time for dinner, \n",
      "so I volunteered to go back up. When I entered Peter's room, I apologized for \n",
      "\n",
      "disturbing him again. As I was going up the stairs, he stood up, went over to stand \n",
      "\n",
      "between the stairs and the wall, grabbed my arm and tried to stop me. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"I'll go,\" he said. \"I have to go upstairs anyway.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I replied that it wasn't really necessary, that I didn't have to get only the small ones \n",
      "this time. Convinced, he let go of my arm. On my way back, he opened the trapdoor \n",
      "\n",
      "and once again took the pan from me. Standing by the door, I asked, \"What are you \n",
      "\n",
      "working on?\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\"French,\" he replied. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After I'd explained some French to him, we began to talk. He told me that after the \n",
      "war he wanted to go to the Dutch East Indies and live on a rubber plantation. He \n",
      "talked about his life at home, the black market and how he felt like a worthless bum. \n",
      "I told him he had a big inferiority complex. He talked about the war, saying that \n",
      "Russia and England were bound to go to war against each other, and about the Jews. \n",
      "He said life would have been much easier if he'd been a Christian or could become \n",
      "one after the war. I asked if he wanted to be baptized, but that wasn't what he meant \n",
      "either. He said he'd never be able to feel like a Christian, but that after the war he'd \n",
      "make sure nobody would know he was Jewish. I felt a momentary pang. It's such a \n",
      "shame he still has a touch of dishonesty in him. \n",
      "\n",
      "Peter added, \"The Jews have been and always will be the chosen people!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I answered, \"Just this once, I hope they'll be chosen for something good!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "But we went on chatting very pleasantly, about Father, about judging human character \n",
      "and all sorts of things, so many that I can't even remember them all. \n",
      "\n",
      "I left at a quarter past five, because Bep had arrived. \n",
      "\n",
      "That evening he said something else I thought was nice. We were talking about the \n",
      "picture of a movie star I'd once given him, which has been hanging in his room for at \n",
      "least a year and a half. He liked it so much that I offered to give him a few more. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"No,\" he replied, \"I'd rather keep the one I've got. I look at it every day, and the \n",
      "people in it have become my friends.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I now have a better understanding of why he always hugs Mouschi so tightly. He \n",
      "obviously needs affection too. I forgot to mention something else he was talking about. \n",
      "He said, \"No, I'm not afraid, except when it comes to things about myself, but I'm \n",
      "working on that.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Peter has a huge inferiority complex. For example, he always thinks he's so stupid and \n",
      "we're so smart. When I help him with French, he thanks me a thousand times. One of \n",
      "these days I'm going to say, \"Oh, cut it out! You're much better at English and \n",

      "\n",
      "I decided I had to take a chance right then and there, so I got my notebook and let \n",

      "all and looks at the others in the same tender way. Maybe I only imagined it was \n",

      "they swooped through the air, and we were so moved and entranced that we couldn't \n",

      "remained like this for a long while, and by the time he had to go to the loft to chop \n",

      "followed; during the fifteen minutes he was chopping wood, we didn't say a word \n",
      "either. I watched him from where I was standing, and could see he was obviously \n",
      "doing his best to chop the right way and show off his strength. But I also looked out \n",

      "When I think back to my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. The Anne Frank who \n",
      "enjoyed that heavenly existence was completely different from the one who has grown \n",
      "wise within these walls. Yes, it was heavenly. Five admirers on every street corner, \n",
      "twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers, spoiled rotten by Father \n",
      "and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance. What more could anyone ask for? \n",
      "\n",
      "You're probably wondering how I could have charmed all those people. Peter says It s \n",
      "ecause I m \"attractive,\" but that isn't it entirely. The teachers were amused and \n",
      "entertained by my clever answers, my witty remarks, my smthng face and my critical \n",
      "mind. That's all I was: a terrible flirt, coquettish and amusing. I had a few plus points, \n",
      "which kept me in everybody's good graces: I was hardworking, honest and generous. I \n",
      "would never have refused anyone who wanted to peek at my answers, I was \n",
      "magnanimous with my candy, and I wasn't stuck-up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would all that admiration eventually have made me overconfident? It's a good thing \n",
      "that, at the height of my glory, I was suddenly plunged into reality. It took me more \n",
      "than a year to get used to doing without admiration. \n",
      "\n",
      "How did they see me at school? As the class comedian, the eternal ringleader, never \n",
      "in a bad mood, never a crybaby. Was it any wonder that everyone wanted to bicycle \n",
      "to school with me or do me little favors? \n",
      "\n",
      "I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but superficial girl, who has \n",
      "nothing to do with me. What did Peter say about me? \"Whenever I saw you, you were \n",

      "\n",

      "But there's the catch. I'd like to live that seemingly carefree and happy life for an \n",

      "grateful to the first person to talk to me about something meaningful. I want friends, \n",
      "not admirers. Peo- pie who respect me for my character and my deeds, not my \n",

      "matter, as long as they're sincere? \n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of everything, I wasn't altogether happy in 1942; I often felt I'd been \n",
      "deserted, but because I was on the go all day long, I didn't think about it. I enjoyed \n",

      "I see my life up to New Year's 1944 as if I were looking through a powerful \n",
      "magnifying glass. When I was at home, my life was filled with sunshine. Then, in the \n",
      "middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels, the accusations — I \n",
      "couldn't take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only way I knew to keep my \n",

      "\n",
      "The first half of 1943 brought crying spells, loneliness and the gradual realization of \n",
      "my faults and short- comings, which were numerous and seemed even more so. I \n",

      "\n",
      "The second half of the year was slightly better. I became a teenager, and was treated \n",
      "more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to write stories, finally \n",
      "\n",
      "coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anything to do with me. They \n",
      "\n",
      "had no right to swing me back and forth like a pendulum on a clock. I wanted to \n",
      "change myself in my own way. I realized I could man- age without my mother, \n",
      "\n",
      "completely and totally, and that hurt. But what affected me even more was the \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "and I have only recently gotten to know each other and yet still tell each other very \n",
      "\n",

      "He'd thought I was a noisy pest, and I'd quickly concluded that he was nothing special. \n",
      "I didn't understand why he didn't flirt with me, but now I'm glad. He also mentioned \n",
      "how he often used to retreat to his room. I said that my noise and exuberance and his \n",
      "silence were two sides of the same coin, and that I also liked peace and quiet but \n",
      "don't have anything for myself alone, except my diary, and that everyone would rather \n",
      "see the back of me, starting with Mr. Dussel, and that I don't always want to sit with \n",

      "I am that he's here. \n",
      "\n",

      "It was wonderful. He must have come to love me as a friend, and, for the time being, \n",

      "outside. The van Daans and Dussel make the silliest remarks when I disappear into his \n",
      "room. \"Annes zweite Heimat,\"* [* Anne's second home] they say, or \"Is it proper for \n",
      "a gentleman to receive young girls in his room at night with the lights out?\" Peter has \n",
      "amazing presence of mind in the face of these so-called witticisms. My mother, \n",
      "incidentally, is also bursting with curiosity and simply dying to ask what we talk \n",

      "was a second set of labia on the inside, since you couldn't see them. What's even \n",
      "\n",
      "funnier is that I thought urine came out of the clitoris. I asked Mother one time what \n",
      "that little bump was, and she said she didn't know. She can really play dumb when \n",
      "she wants to! \n",
      "\n",
      "But to get back to the subject. How on earth can you explain what it all looks like \n",

      "\n",
      "When you're standing up, all you see from the front is hair. Between your legs there \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "labia, there's a fold of skin that, on second thought, looks like a kind of blister. That's \n",
      "the clitoris. Then come the inner labia, which are also pressed together in a kind of \n",
      "crease. When they open up, you can see a fleshy little mound, no bigger than the top \n",
      "of my thumb. The upper part has a couple of small holes in it, which is where the \n",
      "urine comes out. The lower part looks as if it were just skin, and yet that's where \n",
      "the vagina is. You can barely find it, because the folds of skin hide the opening. The \n",
      "hole's so small I can hardly imagine how a man could get in there, much less how a \n",
      "baby could come out. It's hard enough trying to get your index finger inside. That's all \n",

      "close, leaning against two other crates; Mouschi kept us company, so we weren't \n",
      "without a chaperon. Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. van Daan whistled and asked if \n",
      "we had Mr. Dussel's cushion. We jumped up and went downstairs willi the cushion, the \n",
      "cat and Mr. van Daan. This cushion was the source of much misery. Dussel was angry \n",
      "\n",
      "because I'd taken the one he uses as a pillow, and he was afraid it might be covered \n",
      "\n",
      "with fleas; he had the entire house in an uproar because of this one cushion. In \n",
      "revenge, Peter and I stuck two hard brushes in his bed, but had to take them out \n",

      "\"That sounds fishy,\" I said to Margot. \"It's obviously a pretext. You can tell by the \n",

      "downstairs in a flash. Margot, Mother, Mrs. van D. and I waited. Four frightened \n",

      "that all was quiet. The clock struck quarter to ten. The color had drained from our \n",
      "faces, but we remained calm, even though we were afraid. Where were the men? What \n",

      "kick from outside sent it flying to the floor. The men were amazed at the burglars' \n",

      "was re- placed, and once more the attempt was foiled. Outside, a man and a woman \n",
      "shone a glaring flashlight through the opening, lighting up the entire warehouse. \"What \n",
      "the ...\" mumbled one of the men, but now their roles had been reversed. Instead of \n",
      "policemen, they were now burglars. All four of them raced upstairs. Dussel and Mr. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "nothing, but simply sat there in pitch darkness — in her fear, Mrs. van D. had \n",
      "switched off the lamp. We whispered, and every time we heard a creak, someone said, \n",
      "\"Shh, shh.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten-thirty, then eleven. Not a sound. Father and Mr. van Daan took turns \n",
      "coming upstairs to us. Then, at eleven-fifteen, a noise below. Up above you could \n",
      "hear the whole family breathing. For the rest, no one moved a muscle. Footsteps in \n",
      "the house, the private office, the kitchen, then. . . on the staircase. All sounds of \n",
      "breathing stopped, eight hearts pounded. Foot- steps on the stairs, then a rattling at \n",
      "the bookcase. This moment is indescribable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're done for,\" I said, and I had visions of all fifteen of us being dragged away \n",
      "by the Gestapo that very night. \n",
      "\n",
      "More rattling at the bookcase, twice. Then we heard a can fall, and the footsteps \n",
      "receded. We were out of danger, so far! A shiver went though everyone's body, I \n",
      "heard several sets of teeth chattering, no one said a word. We stayed like this until \n",
      "eleven— thirty. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no more sounds in the house, but a light was shining on our landing, right \n",
      "in front of the bookcase. Was that because the police thought it looked so suspicious \n",
      "or because they simply forgot? Was anyone going to come back and turn it off? We \n",
      "found our tongues again. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no longer any people inside the building, but perhaps someone was \n",
      "standing guard outside. We then did three things: tried to guess what was going on, \n",
      "trembled with fear and went to the bathroom. Since the buckets were in the attic, all \n",
      "we had was Peter's metal wastepaper basket. Mr. van Daan went first, then Father, \n",
      "but Mother was too embarrassed. Father brought the waste- basket to the next room, \n",
      "where Margot, Mrs. van Daan and I gratefully made use of it. Mother finally gave in. \n",
      "There was a great demand for paper, and luckily I had some in my pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wastebasket stank, everything went on in a whisper, and we were exhausted. It \n",
      "was midnight. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lie down on the floor and go to sleep!\" Margot and I were each given a pillow and a \n",
      "blanket. Margot lay down near the food cupboard, and I made my bed between the \n",
      "table legs. The smell wasn't quite so bad when you were lying on the floor, but Mrs. \n",
      "van Daan quietly went and got some powdered bleach and draped a dish towel over \n",
      "the potty as a further precaution. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Talk, whispers, fear, stench, farting and people continually going to the bathroom; try \n",
      "sleeping through that! By two-thirty, however, I was so tired I dozed off and didn't \n",
      "hear a thing until three — thirty. I woke up when Mrs. van D. lay her head on my feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, give me something to put on!\" I said. I was handed some clothes, \n",
      "but don't ask what: a pair of wool slacks over my pajamas, a red sweater and a black \n",
      "skirt, white understockings and tattered kneesocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. van D. sat back down on the chair, and Mr. van D. lay down with his head on \n",
      "my feet. From three- thirty onward I was engrossed in thought, and still shiver- ing \n",
      "so much that Mr. van Daan couldn't sleep. I was preparing myself for the return of \n",
      "the police. We'd tell them we were in hiding; if they were good people, we'd be safe, \n",
      "and if they were Nazi sympathizers, we could try to bribe them! \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should hide the radio!\" moaned Mrs. van D. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure, in the stove,\" answered Mr. van D. \"If they find us, they might as well find the \n",
      "radio!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then they'll also find Anne's diary,\" added Father. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"So burn it,\" suggested the most terrified of the group. \n",
      "\n",
      "This and the police rattling on the bookcase were the moments when I was most \n",
      "afraid. Oh, not my diary; if my diary goes, I go too! Thank goodness Father didn't say \n",
      "anything more. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's no point in recounting all the conversations; so much was said. I comforted \n",
      "Mrs. van Daan, who was very frightened. We talked about escaping, being interrogated \n",
      "by the Gestapo, phoning Mr. Kleiman and being courageous. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must behave like soldiers, Mrs. van Daan. If our time has come, well then, it'll be \n",
      "for Queen and Country, for freedom, truth and justice, as they're always telling us on \n",
      "the radio. The only bad thing is that we'll drag the others down with us!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour Mr. van Daan switched places with his wife again, and Father came and \n",
      "sat beside me. The men smoked one cigarette after another, an occasional sigh was \n",
      "heard, somebody made another trip to the potty, and then everything began allover \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "so close we could feel each other's bodies trembling; we spoke a word or two from \n",
      "time to time and listened intently. Next door they took down the blackout screen. \n",
      "They made a list of everything they were planning to tell Mr. Kleiman over the phone, \n",
      "because they intended to call him at seven and ask him to send someone over. They \n",
      "were taking a big chance, since the police guard at the door or in the warehouse \n",
      "might hear them calling, but there was an even greater risk that the police would \n",
      "return. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm enclosing their list, but for the sake of clarity, I'll copy it here. \n",

      "\n",
      "There was a knocking at our bookcase. Miep whis- tied. This was too much for Mrs. \n",

      "\n",
      "Jan and Miep came in and were met with a delightful scene. The table alone would \n",

      "dancing girls and smeared with jam and pectin, which we'd been taking to combat the \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Jan and Miep were of course greeted with shouts and tears. Jan nailed a pinewood \n",
      "board over the gap in the door and went off again with Miep to inform the police of \n",
      "the break-in. Miep had also found a note under the ware- house door from Sleegers, \n",
      "the night watchman, who had noticed the hole and alerted the police. Jan was also \n",
      "planning to see Sleegers. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we had half an hour in which to put the house and ourselves to rights. I've never \n",
      "seen such a transformation as in those thirty minutes. Margot and I got the beds \n",
      "ready downstairs, went to the bathroom, brushed our teeth, washed our hands and \n",
      "combed our hair. Then I straightened up the room a bit and went back upstairs. The \n",
      "table had already been cleared, so we got some water, made coffee and tea, boiled the \n",
      "milk and set the table. Father and Peter emptied our improvised potties and rinsed \n",
      "them with warm water and powdered bleach. The largest one was filled to the brim \n",
      "and was so heavy they had a hard time lifting it. To make things worse, it was \n",
      "leaking, so they had to put it in a bucket. \n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock Jan was back and joined us at the table, and gradually everyone \n",
      "began to relax. Jan had the following story to tell: \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Sleegers was asleep, but his wife told Jan that her husband had discovered the \n",
      "hole in the door while making his rounds. He called in a policeman, and the two of \n",
      "them searched the building. Mr. Sleegers, in his capacity as night watchman, patrols \n",
      "the area every night on his bike, accompanied by his two dogs. His wife said he would \n",
      "come on Tuesday and tell Mr. Kugler the rest. No one at the police station seemed to \n",
      "\n",
      "know anything about the break-in, but they made a note to come first thing Tuesday \n",
      "\n",
      "morning to have a look. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the way back Jan happened to run into Mr. van Hoeven, the man who supplies us \n",
      "with potatoes, and told him of the break— in. \"I know,\" Mr. van Hoeven calmly replied. \n",
      "\"Last night when my wife and I were walking past your building, I saw a gap in the \n",
      "\n",
      "door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I peeked inside with a flashlight, and that's \n",
      "\n",
      "when the burglars must have run off. To be on the safe side, I didn't call the police. I \n",
      "thought it wouldn't be wise in your case. I don't know anything, but I have my \n",
      "suspicions.\" Jan thanked him and went on. Mr. van Hoeven obviously suspects we're \n",
      "here, because he always delivers the potatoes at lunchtime. A decent man! \n",
      "\n",
      "It was one o'clock by the time Jan left and we'd done the dishes. All eight of us went \n",
      "to bed. I woke up at quarter to three and saw that Mr. Dussel was already up. My \n",
      "face rumpled with sleep, I happened to run into Peter in the bathroom, just after he'd \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "come downstairs. We agreed to meet in the office. I freshened up a bit and went \n",
      "down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all this, do you still dare go to the front attic?\" he asked. I nodded, grabbed \n",
      "my pillow, with a cloth wrapped around it, and we went up together. The weather was \n",
      "gorgeous, and even though the air-raid sirens soon began to wail, we stayed where \n",
      "we were. Peter put his arm around my shoulder, I put mine around his, and we sat \n",
      "quietly like this until four o'clock, when Margot came to get us for coffee. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ate our bread, drank our lemonade and joked (we were finally able to again), and \n",
      "for the rest everything was back to normal. That evening I thanked Peter because he'd \n",
      "been the bravest of us all. \n",
      "\n",
      "None of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night. God was truly \n",
      "watching over us. Just think-the police were right at the bookcase, the light was on, \n",
      "and still no one had discovered our hiding place! \"Now we're done for!\" I'd whispered \n",
      "at that moment, but once again we were spared. When the invasion comes and the \n",
      "bombs start falling, it'll be every man for himself, but this time we feared for those \n",
      "good, innocent Christians who are helping us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been saved, keep on saving us!\" That's all we can say. \n",
      "\n",
      "This incident has brought about a whole lot of changes. As of now, Dussel will be \n",
      "doing his work in the bathroom, and Peter will be patrolling the house between \n",
      "eight-thirty and nine-thirty. Peter isn't allowed to open his window anymore, since \n",
      "one of the Keg people noticed it was open. We can no longer flush the toilet after \n",

      "carpenter from the underground is coming to make a barricade out of our white \n",
      "Frankfurt bedsteads. Debates are going on left and right in the Annex. Mr. Kugler has \n",
      "reproached us for our carelessness. Jan also said we should never go downstairs. What \n",
      "we have to do now is find out whether Sleegers can be trusted, whether the dogs will \n",
      "bark if they hear someone behind the door, how to make the barricade, all sorts of \n",

      "through such suffering? It's God who has made us the way we are, but it's also God \n",
      "who will lift us up again. In the eyes of the world, we're doomed, but if, after all this \n",
      "suffering, there are still Jews left, the Jewish people will be held up as an example. \n",
      "Who knows, maybe our religion will teach the world and all the people in it about \n",
      "goodness, and that's the reason, the only reason, we have to suffer. We can never be \n",
      "just Dutch, or just English, or whatever, we will always be Jews as well. And we'll \n",
      "have to keep on being Jews, but then, we'll want to be. \n",
      "\n",
      "Be brave! Let's remember our duty and perform it without complaint. There will be a \n",
      "way out. God has never deserted our people. Through the ages Jews have had to \n",
      "suffer, but through the ages they've gone on living, and the centuries of suffering have \n",

      "sensitive. As soon as I came downstairs, I went with Father to get some water. While \n",
      "we were on the stairs, I said, \"Father, I'm sure you've gathered that when Peter and I \n",

      "\n",
      "\"We've already agreed not to quarrel, and I plan to keep my promise.\" \n",

      "\n",
      "I'm afraid that people who know me as I usually am will discover I have another side, \n",
      "a better and finer side. I'm afraid they'll mock me, think I'm ridiculous and sentimental \n",
      "and not take me seriously. I'm used to not being taken seriously, but only the \n",
      "\"lighthearted\" Anne is used to it and can put up with it: the \"deeper\" Anne is too \n",

      "to be, how I am ... on the inside. But unfortunately I'm only like that with myself. \n",
      "And perhaps that's why-no, I'm sure that's the reason why — I think of myself as \n",

      "happy-go-lucky Anne laughs, gives a flippant reply, shrugs her shoulders and \n",
      "pretends she doesn't give a darn. The quiet Anne reacts in just the opposite way. If \n",

      "\n",
      "Anne Frank kept a diary from June 12, 1942, to August 1, 1944. Initially, she wrote \n",
      "it strictly for herself. Then, one day in 1944, Gerrit Bolkestein, a member of the \n",
      "Dutch government in exile, announced in a radio broadcast from Fondon that after the \n",
      "war he hoped to collect eyewitness accounts of the suffering of the Dutch people \n",
      "under the German occupation, which could be made available to the public. As an \n",
      "example, he specifically mentioned letters and diaries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Impressed by this speech, Anne Frank decided that when the war was over she would \n",
      "publish a book based on her diary. She began rewriting and editing her diary, \n",
      "improving on the text, omitting passages she didn't think were interesting enough and \n",
      "adding others from memory. At the same time, she kept up her original diary. In the \n",
      "scholarly work The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition (1989), Anne's first, \n",
      "unedited diary is referred to as version a, to distinguish it from her second, edited \n",
      "diary, which is known as version b. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last entry in Anne's diary is dated August 1, 1944. On August 4, 1944, the eight \n",
      "people hiding in the Secret Annex were arrested. Miep Gies and Bep Voskuijl, the two \n",
      "secretaries working in the building, found Anne's diaries strewn allover the floor. ,Miep \n",
      "Gies tucked them away in a desk drawer for safekeeping. After the war, when it \n",
      "became clear that Anne was dead, she gave the diaries, unread, to Anne's father, Otto \n",

      "the city? In the country? In a house? In a shack? When, where, how. . . ? These \n",
      "were questions I wasn't allowed to ask, but they still kept running through my mind. \n",
      "\n",
      "Margot and I started packing our most important belongings into a schoolbag. The first \n",
      "thing I stuck in was this diary, and then curlers, handkerchiefs, schoolbooks, a comb \n",
      "and some old letters. Preoccupied by the thought of going into hiding, I stuck the \n",

      "Father finally came hQme around five o'clock, and we called Mr. Kleiman to ask if he \n",

      "1933, has become a close friend, and so has her husband Jan. Once again, shoes, \n",

      "The four of us were wrapped in so many layers of clothes it looked as if we were \n",
      "going off to spend the night in a refrigerator, and all that just so we could take more \n",
      "clothes with us. No Jew in our situation would dare leave the house with a suitcase \n",
      "full of clothes. I was wearing two undershirts, three pairs of underpants, a dress, and \n",
      "over that a skirt, a jacket, a raincoat, two pairs of stockings, heavy shoes, a cap, a \n",

      "a schoolbag and a shopping bag filled to the brim with the most varied assortment of \n",
      "items. The people on their way to work at that early hour gave us sympathetic looks; \n",
      "you could tell by their faces that they were sorry they couldn't offer us some kind of \n",
      "transportation; the conspicuous yellow star spoke for itself. \n",
      "\n",
      "Only when we were walking down the street did Father and Mother reveal, little by \n",
      "little, what the plan was. For months we'd been moving as much of our furniture and \n",
      "apparel out of the apartment as we could. It was agreed that we'd go into hiding on \n",
      "July 16. Because of Margot's call-up notice, the plan had to be moved up ten days, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The hiding place was located in Father's office building. That's a little hard for \n",
      "outsiders to understand, so I'll explain. Father didn't have a lot of people working in \n",
      "his office, just Mr. Kugler, Mr. Kleiman, Miep and a twenty— three— year— old typist \n",
      "named Bep Voskuijl, all of whom were informed of our coming. Mr. Voskuijl, Bep's \n",
      "father, works in the warehouse, along with two assistants, none of whom were told \n",
      "anything. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a description of the building. The large warehouse on the ground floor is used \n",
      "as a workroom and storeroom and is divided into several different sections, such as \n",
      "the stockroom and the milling room, where cinnamon, cloves and a pepper substitute \n",
      "are ground. \n",
      "\n",
      "Next to the warehouse doors is another outside' door, a separate entrance to the \n",
      "office. Just inside the office door is a second door, and beyond that a stairway. At the \n",
      "top of the stairs is another door, with a frosted window on which the word \"Office\" is \n",
      "written in black letters. This is the big front office — very large, very light and \n",
      "very full. Bep, Miep and Mr. Kleiman work there during the day. After passing through \n",
      "an alcove containing a safe, a wardrobe and a big supply cupboard, you come to the \n",
      "small, dark, stuffy back office. This used to be shared by Mr. Kugler and Mr. van \n",
      "Daan, but now Mr. Kugler is its only occupant. Mr. Kugler's office can also be reached \n",
      "from the hallway, but only through a glass door that can be opened from the inside \n",
      "but not easily from the outside. If you leave Mr. Kugler's office and proceed through \n",
      "the long, narrow hallway past the coal bin and go up four steps, you find yourself in \n",
      "the private office, the showpiece of the entire building. Elegant mahogany furniture, a \n",
      "linoleum floor covered with throw rugs, a radio, a fancy lamp, everything first class. \n",
      "Next door is a spacious kitchen with a hot-water heater and two gas burners, and \n",
      "beside that a bathroom. That's the second floor. \n",
      "\n",
      "A wooden staircase leads from the downstairs hallway to the third floor. At the top of \n",
      "the stairs is a landing, with doors on either side. The door on the left takes you up to \n",
      "the spice storage area, attic and loft in the front part of the house. A typically Dutch, \n",
      "very steep, ankle-twisting flight of stairs also runs from the front part of the house \n",
      "to another door opening onto the street. \n",
      "\n",
      "The door to the right of the landing leads to the \"Secret Annex\" at the back ofthe \n",

      "such a large, light and spacious room in an old canalside house like this. It contains a \n",

      "But first, let me continue my story, because, as you know, I wasn't finished. After we \n",

      "\n",

      "last few months were piled on the floors and beds. The small room was filled from \n",

      "floor to cethng with linens. If we wanted to sleep in properly made beds that night, \n",
      "\n",
      "we had to get going and straighten up the mess. Mother and Margot were unable to \n",
      "move a muscle. They lay down on their bare mattresses, tired, miserable and I don't \n",
      "know what else. But Father and I, the two cleaner- uppers in the family, started in \n",
      "right away. \n",
      "\n",
      "All day long we unpacked boxes, filled cupboards, hammered nails and straightened up \n",
      "the mess, until we fell exhausted into our clean beds at night. We hadn't eaten a hot \n",

      "was based on something so trivial it didn't seem worth wasting a single word on it. \n",
      "Oh well, to each his own. \n",
      "\n",
      "Of course, it's very difficult for Peter, who gets caught in the middle, but no one \n",
      "takes Peter seriously anymore, since he's hypersensitive and lazy. Yesterday he was \n",
      "beside himself with worry because his tongue was blue instead of pink. This rare \n",
      "phenomenon disappeared as quickly as it came. Today he's walking around with a \n",
      "heavy scarf on because he's got a stiff neck. His Highness has been complaining of \n",
      "lumbago too. Aches and pains in his heart, kidneys and lungs are also par for the \n",
      "course. He's an absolute hypochondriac! (That's the right word, isn't it?) \n",
      "\n",
      "Mother and Mrs. van Daan aren't getting along very well. There are enough reasons \n",
      "for the friction. To give you one small example, Mrs. van D. has removed all but \n",
      "three of her sheets from our communal linen closet. She's assuming that Mother's can \n",
      "be used for both families. She'll be in for a nasty surprise when she discovers that \n",
      "Mother has followed her lead. \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Mrs. van D. is ticked off because we're using her china instead of ours. \n",
      "She's still trying to find out what we've done with our plates! they're a lot closer than \n",
      "she thinks, since they're packed in cardboard boxes in the attic, behind a load of \n",
      "Opekta advertising material. As long as we're in hiding, the plates will remain out of \n",
      "her reach. Since I'm always having accidents, it's just as well! Yesterday I broke one \n",
      "of Mrs. van D.'s soup bowls. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she angrily exclaimed. \"Can't you be more careful? That was my last one.\" \n",

      "Last week there was a brief interruption in our monotonous routine. This was provided \n",
      "by Peter — and a book about women. I should explain that Margot and Peter are \n",
      "allowed to read nearly all the books Mr. Kleiman lends us. But the adults preferred to \n",
      "keep this special book to themselves. This immediately piqued Peter's curiosity. What \n",
      "forbidden fruit did it contain? He snuck off with it when his mother was downstairs \n",
      "talking, and took himself and his booty to the loft. For two days all was well. Mrs. \n",
      "van Daan knew what he was up to, but kept mum until Mr. van Daan found out about \n",
      "it. He threw a fit, took the book away and assumed that would be the end of the \n",
      "business. However, he'd neglected to take his son's curiosity into account. Peter, not \n",
      "in the least fazed by his father's swift action, began thinking up ways to read the rest \n",
      "of this vastly interesting book. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime, Mrs. van D. asked Mother for her opinion. Mother didn't think this \n",
      "particular book was suitable for Margot, but she saw no harm in letting her read most \n",
      "other books. \n",
      "\n",
      "You see, Mrs. van Daan, Mother Said, there's a big difference between Margot and \n",
      "Peter. To begin with, Margot's a girl, and girls are always more mature than boys. \n",
      "Second, she's already read many serious books and doesn't go looking for those which \n",
      "are no longer forbidden. Third, Margot's much more sensible and intellectually \n",
      "\n",
      "advanced, as a result of her four years at an excellent school.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. van Daan agreed with her, but felt it was wrong as a matter of principle to let \n",
      "youngsters read books written for adults. \n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, Peter had thought of a suitable time when no one would be interested in \n",
      "either him or the book. At seven— thirty in the evening, when the entire family was \n",
      "listening to the radio in the private office, he took his treasure and stole off to the \n",
      "loft again. He should have been back by eight-thirty, but he was so engrossed in the \n",
      "book that he forgot the time and was just coming down the stairs when his father \n",
      "\n",
      "entered the room. The scene that followed was not surprising: after a slap, a whack \n",
      "\n",
      "and a tug-of-war, the book lay on the table and Peter was in the loft. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is how matters stood when it was time for the family to eat. Peter stayed \n",
      "\n",
      "upstairs. No one gave him a moment's thought; he'd have to go to bed without his \n",
      "dinner. We continued eating, chatting merrily away, when suddenly we heard a piercing \n",
      "whistle. We lay down our forks and stared at each other, the shock clearly visible on \n",
      "our pale faces. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Then we heard Peter's voice through the chimney: \"I won t come down!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. van Daan leapt up, his napkin falling to the floor, and shouted, with the blood \n",
      "rushing to his face, \"I've had enough!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Father, afraid of what might happen, grabbed him by the arm and the two men went \n",
      "to the attic. After much struggling and kicking, Peter wound up in his room with the \n",
      "door shut, and we went on eating. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. van Daan wanted to save a piece of bread for her darling son, but Mr. van D. \n",
      "was adamant. \"If he doesn't apologize this minute, he'll have to sleep in the loft.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "We protested that going without dinner was enough punishment. What if Peter were to \n",
      "catch cold? We wouldn't be able to call a doctor. \n",
      "\n",
      "Peter didn't apologize, and returned to the loft. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. van Daan decided to leave well enough alone, though he did note the next morning \n",
      "that Peter's bed had been slept in. At seven Peter went to the attic again, but was \n",
      "persuaded to come downstairs when Father spoke a few friendly words to him. After \n",

      "This way Mr. Broks can read the letter without suspecting a ruse. They chose the \n",

      "and making a lot of noise. Then we all tiptoed in our stockinged feet to the van Daans \n",
      "on the next floor. Mr. van D. had a bad cold and had already gone to bed, so we \n",
      "gathered around his bedside and discussed our suspicions in a whisper. Every time Mr. \n",
      "van D. coughed loudly, Mrs. van D. and I nearly had a nervous fit. He kept coughing \n",

      "Once again we waited and waited, but heard nothing. Finally we came to the \n",
      "conclusion that the burglars had taken to their heels when they heard footsteps in an \n",
      "otherwise quiet building. The problem now was that the chairs in the private office \n",
      "were neatly grouped around the radio, which was tuned to England. If the burglars \n",
      "had forced the door and the air-raid wardens were to notice it and call the police, \n",
      "there could be very serious repercus sions. So Mr. van Daan got up, pulled on his coat \n",
      "and pants, put on his hat and cautiously followed Father down the stairs, with Peter \n",
      "(armed with a heavy hammer, to be on the safe side) right behind him. The ladies \n",
      "(including Margot and me) waited in suspense until the men returned five minutes \n",
      "later and reported that there was no sign of any activity in the building. We agreed \n",
      "not to run any water or flush the toilet; but since everyone's stomach was churning \n",
      "from all the tension, you can imagine the stench after we'd each had a turn in the \n",
      "bathroom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Incidents like these are always accompanied by other disasters, and this was no \n",
      "exception. Number one: the Westertoren bells stopped chiming, and I'd always found \n",
      "them so comforting. Number two: Mr. Voskuijlleft early last night, and we weren't \n",
      "sure if he'd given Bep the key and she'd forgotten to lock the door. \n",
      "\n",
      "But that was of little importance now. The night had just begun, and we still weren't \n",
      "sure what to expect. We were somewhat reassured by the fact that between \n",
      "\n",
      "eight-fifteen — when the burglar had first entered the building and put our lives in \n",
      "\n",
      "jeopardy, and ten-thirty, we hadn't heard a sound. The more we thought about it, the \n",
      "\n",
      "less likely it seemed that a burglar would have forced a door so early in the evening, \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "In Memoriam \n",
      "\n",
      "My fountain pen was always one of my most prized possessions; I valued it highly, \n",
      "especially because it had a thick nib, and I can only write neatly with thick nibs. It \n",
      "has led a long and interesting fountain-pen life, which I will summarize below. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was nine, my fountain pen (packed in cotton) arrived as a \"sample of no \n",
      "commercial value\" all the way from Aachen, where my grandmother (the kindly donor) \n",
      "used to live. I lay in bed with the flu, while the February winds howled around the \n",
      "apartment house. This splendid fountain pen came in a red leather case, and I showed \n",
      "it to my girlfriends the first chance I got. Me, Anne Frank, the proud owner of a \n",
      "fountain pen. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I was ten, I was allowed to take the pen to school, and to my surprise, the \n",

      "be tucked away again, because my sixth-grade teacher allowed us to use only school \n",
      "pens and inkpots. When I was twelve, I started at the Jewish Fyceum and my fountain \n",
      "pen was given a new case in honor of the occasion. Not only did it have room for a \n",
      "pencil, it also had a zipper, which was much more impressive. When I was thirteen, \n",
      "the fountain pen went with me to the Annex, and together we've raced through \n",
      "countless diaries and compositions. I'd turned fourteen and my fountain pen was \n",
      "enjoying the last year of its life with me when . . . \n",
      "\n",
      "It was just after five on Friday afternoon. I came out of my room and was about to \n",
      "sit down at the table to write when I was roughly pushed to one side to make room \n",
      "for Margot and Father, who wanted to practice their Latin. The fountain pen remained \n",
      "unused on the table, while its owner, sighing, was forced to make do with a very tiny \n",
      "corner of the table, where she began rubbing beans. That's how we remove mold from \n",
      "the beans and restore them to their original state. At a quarter to six I swept the \n",
      "floor, dumped the dirt into a news paper, along with the rotten beans, and tossed it \n",
      "into the stove. A giant flame shot up, and I thought it was wonderful that the stove, \n",
      "which had been gasping its last breath, had made such a miraculous recovery. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "All was quiet again. The Latin students had left, and I sat down at the table to pick \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "up where I'd left off. But no matter where I looked, my fountain pen was nowhere in \n",

      "But it had vanished. \n",
      "\n",

      "But that evening, when my fountain pen still hadn't turned up, we all assumed it had \n",

      "confirmed the next day when Father went to empty the stove and discovered the clip, \n",
      "used to fasten it to a pocket, among the ashes. Not a trace of the gold nib was left. \n",
      "\"It must have melted into stone,\" Father conjectured. \n",

      "or Mrs. van Daan. We all noticed it. This went on for a few days, and then Mother \n",
      "took the opportunity to warn him about Mrs. van D., who could make life miserable \n",
      "for him. Dussel said Mr. van Daan had started the silent treatment and he had no \n",
      "intention of breaking it. I should explain that yesterday was November 16, the first \n",

      "\n",
      "I can say without exaggeration that Dussel has definitely got a screw loose. We often \n",

      "Sally. For a long time we went everywhere together, but aside from that, my love was \n",
      "unrequited until Peter crossed my path. I had an out-and-out crush on him. He liked \n",

      "hand in hand through our neighborhood, Peter in a white cotton suit and me in a short \n",

      "the middle school, while I was in the sixth grade at the grammar school. He'd pick me \n",
      "up on the way home, or I'd pick him up. Peter was the ideal boy: tall, good-looking \n",
      "and slender, with a serious, quiet and intelligent face. He had dark hair, beautiful \n",
      "brown eyes, ruddy cheeks and a nicely pointed nose. I was crazy about his smile, \n",
      "which made him look so boyish and mischievous. \n",
      "\n",

      "looked happy, and yet there was something so sad in my expression that the smile \n",
      "immediately faded from my lips. I'm not happy, since I know Petel's not thinking of \n",

      "\n",
      "When I think back to my life in 1942, it all seems so unreal. The Anne Frank who \n",
      "enjoyed that heavenly existence was completely different from the one who has grown \n",
      "wise within these walls. Yes, it was heavenly. Five admirers on every street corner, \n",
      "twenty or so friends, the favorite of most of my teachers, spoiled rotten by Father \n",
      "and Mother, bags full of candy and a big allowance. What more could anyone ask for? \n",
      "\n",
      "You're probably wondering how I could have charmed all those people. Peter says It s \n",
      "ecause I m \"attractive,\" but that isn't it entirely. The teachers were amused and \n",
      "entertained by my clever answers, my witty remarks, my smthng face and my critical \n",
      "mind. That's all I was: a terrible flirt, coquettish and amusing. I had a few plus points, \n",
      "which kept me in everybody's good graces: I was hardworking, honest and generous. I \n",
      "would never have refused anyone who wanted to peek at my answers, I was \n",
      "magnanimous with my candy, and I wasn't stuck-up. \n",
      "\n",
      "Would all that admiration eventually have made me overconfident? It's a good thing \n",
      "that, at the height of my glory, I was suddenly plunged into reality. It took me more \n",
      "than a year to get used to doing without admiration. \n",
      "\n",
      "How did they see me at school? As the class comedian, the eternal ringleader, never \n",
      "in a bad mood, never a crybaby. Was it any wonder that everyone wanted to bicycle \n",
      "to school with me or do me little favors? \n",
      "\n",
      "I look back at that Anne Frank as a pleasant, amusing, but superficial girl, who has \n",
      "nothing to do with me. What did Peter say about me? \"Whenever I saw you, you were \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "surrounded by a flock of girls and at least two boys, you were always laughing, and \n",

      "still flirt and be amusing, if I want to be . . . \n",
      "\n",
      "But there's the catch. I'd like to live that seemingly carefree and happy life for an \n",
      "evening, a few days, a week. At the end of that week I'd be exhausted, and would be \n",
      "grateful to the first person to talk to me about something meaningful. I want friends, \n",
      "not admirers. Peo- pie who respect me for my character and my deeds, not my \n",
      "flattering smile. The circle around me would be much smaller, but what does that \n",
      "matter, as long as they're sincere? \n",
      "\n",
      "In spite of everything, I wasn't altogether happy in 1942; I often felt I'd been \n",
      "deserted, but because I was on the go all day long, I didn't think about it. I enjoyed \n",

      "\n",
      "I see my life up to New Year's 1944 as if I were looking through a powerful \n",
      "magnifying glass. When I was at home, my life was filled with sunshine. Then, in the \n",
      "middle of 1942, everything changed overnight. The quarrels, the accusations — I \n",
      "couldn't take it all in. I was caught off guard, and the only way I knew to keep my \n",
      "bearings was to talk back. \n",
      "\n",
      "The first half of 1943 brought crying spells, loneliness and the gradual realization of \n",
      "my faults and short- comings, which were numerous and seemed even more so. I \n",
      "filled the day with chatter, tried to draw Pirn closer to me and failed. This left me on \n",
      "my own to face the difficult task of improving myself so I wouldn't have to hear their \n",
      "reproaches, because they made me so despondent. \n",
      "\n",
      "The second half of the year was slightly better. I became a teenager, and was treated \n",
      "more like a grown-up. I began to think about things and to write stories, finally \n",
      "\n",
      "coming to the conclusion that the others no longer had anything to do with me. They \n",
      "\n",
      "had no right to swing me back and forth like a pendulum on a clock. I wanted to \n",
      "change myself in my own way. I realized I could man- age without my mother, \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "realization that I was never going to be able to confide in Father. I didn't trust anyone \n",

      "After New Year's the second big change occurred: my dream, through which I \n",
      "discovered my longing for ... a boy; not for a girlfriend, but for a boyfriend. I also \n",
      "\n",
      "discovered an inner happiness underneath my superficial and cheerful exterior. From \n",
      "\n",
      "time to time I was quiet. Now I live only for Peter, since what happens to me in the \n",
      "\n",
      "future depends largely on him! \n",
      "\n",
      "I lie in bed at night, after ending my prayers with the words \"Ich Janke air fur all das \n",
      "Cute una Liebe una Schone,\"* [* Thank you, God, for all that is good and dear and \n",
      "beautiful.] and I'm filled with joy. I think of going into hiding, my health and my \n",
      "whole being as das Cute; Peter's love (which is still so new and fragile and which \n",

      "Schone. \n",
      "\n",
      "At such moments I don't think about all the misery, but about the beauty that still \n",
      "remains. This is where Mother and I differ greatly. Her advice in the face of \n",
      "melancholy is: \"Think about all the suffering in the world and be thankful you're not \n",
      "part of it.\" My advice is: \"Go outside, to the country, enjoy the sun and all nature has \n",
      "to offer. Go outside and try to recapture the happiness within yourself; think of all the \n",
      "beauty in yourself and in everything around you and be happy.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think Mother's advice can be right, because what are you supposed to do if \n",
      "you become part of the suffering? You'd be completely lost. On the contrary, beauty \n",
      "remains, even in misfortune. If you just look for it, you discover more and more \n",
      "happiness and regain your balance. A person who's happy will make others happy; a \n",

      "wrote you) everything was as usual. Friday afternoon (Good Friday) we played \n",
      "Monopoly; Saturday afternoon too. The days passed very quickly. Around two o'clock \n",
      "on Saturday, heavy firing ii began-machine guns, according to the men. For the rest, \n",
      "everything was quiet. \n",
      "\n",
      "Sunday afternoon Peter came to see me at four- thirty, at my invitation. At \n",
      "five-fifteen we went to the Ii front attic, where we stayed until six. There was a \n",
      "\n",
      "beautil ful Mozart concert on the radio from six to seven-fifteen; I especially enjoyed \n",
      "\n",
      "the Kleine Nachtmusik. I can hardly bear to listen in the kitchen, since beautiful music \n",
      "stirs me to the very depths of my soul. Sunday evening Peter couldn't take his balli, \n",
      "because the washtub was down in the office kitchen, filled with laundry. The two of \n",
      "us went to the front attic together, and in order to be able to sit comfortably, I took \n",
      "along the only cushion I could find in my room. We seated ourselves on a packing \n",
      "crate. Since both the crate and the cushion were very narrow, we were sitting quite \n",
      "close, leaning against two other crates; Mouschi kept us company, so we weren't \n",
      "without a chaperon. Suddenly, at a quarter to nine, Mr. van Daan whistled and asked if \n",
      "we had Mr. Dussel's cushion. We jumped up and went downstairs willi the cushion, the \n",
      "cat and Mr. van Daan. This cushion was the source of much misery. Dussel was angry \n",
      "\n",
      "because I'd taken the one he uses as a pillow, and he was afraid it might be covered \n",
      "\n",
      "with fleas; he had the entire house in an uproar because of this one cushion. In \n",
      "revenge, Peter and I stuck two hard brushes in his bed, but had to take them out \n",
      "again when Dussel unexpectedly decided to go sit in his room. We had a really good \n",
      "laugh at this little intermezzo. \n",
      "\n",
      "But our fun was short-lived. At nine— thirty Peter knocked gently on the door and \n",
      "asked Father to come upstairs and help him with a difficult English sentence. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"That sounds fishy,\" I said to Margot. \"It's obviously a pretext. You can tell by the \n",
      "way the men are talking that there's been a break-in!\" I was right. The warehouse \n",
      "was being broken into at that very moment. Father, Mr. van Daan and Peter were \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "downstairs in a flash. Margot, Mother, Mrs. van D. and I waited. Four frightened \n",
      "women need to talk, so that's what we did until we heard a bang downstairs. After \n",
      "that all was quiet. The clock struck quarter to ten. The color had drained from our \n",
      "faces, but we remained calm, even though we were afraid. Where were the men? What \n",
      "was that bang? Were they fighting with the burglars? We were too scared to think; all \n",
      "we could do was wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "Ten o'clock, footsteps on the stairs. Father, pale and nervous, came inside, followed \n",
      "by Mr. van Daan. \"Lights out, tiptoe upstairs, we're expecting the police!\" There \n",
      "wasn't time to be scared. The lights were switched off, I grabbed a jacket, and we sat \n",
      "down upstairs. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"What happened? Tell us quickly!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "There was no one to tell us; the men had gone back downstairs. The four of them \n",
      "didn't come back up until ten past ten. Two of them kept watch at Peter's open \n",
      "window. The door to the landing was locked, the book- case shut. We draped a \n",
      "sweater over our night-light, and then they told us what had happened: \n",
      "\n",
      "Peter was on the landing when he heard two loud bangs. He went downstairs and saw \n",
      "that a large panel was missing from the left half of the warehouse door. He dashed \n",
      "upstairs, alerted the \"Home Guard,\" and the four of them went downstairs. When they \n",
      "entered the warehouse, the burglars were going about their business. Without thinking, \n",
      "Mr. van Daan yelled \"Police!\" Hur- ried footsteps outside; the burglars had fled. The \n",
      "board was put back in the door so the police wouldn't notice the gap, but then a swift \n",
      "kick from outside sent it flying to the floor. The men were amazed at the burglars' \n",
      "audacity. Both Peter and Mr. van Daan felt a murderous rage come over them. Mr. van \n",
      "Daan slammed an ax against the floor, and all was quiet again. Once more the panel \n",
      "was re- placed, and once more the attempt was foiled. Outside, a man and a woman \n",
      "shone a glaring flashlight through the opening, lighting up the entire warehouse. \"What \n",
      "the ...\" mumbled one of the men, but now their roles had been reversed. Instead of \n",
      "policemen, they were now burglars. All four of them raced upstairs. Dussel and Mr. \n",
      "van Daan snatched up Dussel's books, Peter opened the doors and windows in the \n",
      "kitchen and private office, hurled the phone to the ground, and the four of them finally \n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "In all probability the man and woman with the flashlight had alerted the police. It was \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it, having to sit in such terror for a day and two nights! We thought of \n",
      "nothing, but simply sat there in pitch darkness — in her fear, Mrs. van D. had \n",
      "switched off the lamp. We whispered, and every time we heard a creak, someone said, \n",
      "\"Shh, shh.\" \n",
      "\n",
      "It was ten-thirty, then eleven. Not a sound. Father and Mr. van Daan took turns \n",
      "coming upstairs to us. Then, at eleven-fifteen, a noise below. Up above you could \n",
      "hear the whole family breathing. For the rest, no one moved a muscle. Footsteps in \n",
      "the house, the private office, the kitchen, then. . . on the staircase. All sounds of \n",
      "breathing stopped, eight hearts pounded. Foot- steps on the stairs, then a rattling at \n",
      "the bookcase. This moment is indescribable. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Now we're done for,\" I said, and I had visions of all fifteen of us being dragged away \n",
      "by the Gestapo that very night. \n",
      "\n",
      "More rattling at the bookcase, twice. Then we heard a can fall, and the footsteps \n",
      "receded. We were out of danger, so far! A shiver went though everyone's body, I \n",
      "heard several sets of teeth chattering, no one said a word. We stayed like this until \n",
      "eleven— thirty. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no more sounds in the house, but a light was shining on our landing, right \n",
      "in front of the bookcase. Was that because the police thought it looked so suspicious \n",
      "or because they simply forgot? Was anyone going to come back and turn it off? We \n",
      "found our tongues again. \n",
      "\n",
      "There were no longer any people inside the building, but perhaps someone was \n",
      "standing guard outside. We then did three things: tried to guess what was going on, \n",
      "trembled with fear and went to the bathroom. Since the buckets were in the attic, all \n",
      "we had was Peter's metal wastepaper basket. Mr. van Daan went first, then Father, \n",
      "but Mother was too embarrassed. Father brought the waste- basket to the next room, \n",
      "where Margot, Mrs. van Daan and I gratefully made use of it. Mother finally gave in. \n",
      "There was a great demand for paper, and luckily I had some in my pocket. \n",
      "\n",
      "The wastebasket stank, everything went on in a whisper, and we were exhausted. It \n",
      "was midnight. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Lie down on the floor and go to sleep!\" Margot and I were each given a pillow and a \n",
      "blanket. Margot lay down near the food cupboard, and I made my bed between the \n",
      "table legs. The smell wasn't quite so bad when you were lying on the floor, but Mrs. \n",
      "van Daan quietly went and got some powdered bleach and draped a dish towel over \n",
      "the potty as a further precaution. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Talk, whispers, fear, stench, farting and people continually going to the bathroom; try \n",
      "sleeping through that! By two-thirty, however, I was so tired I dozed off and didn't \n",
      "hear a thing until three — thirty. I woke up when Mrs. van D. lay her head on my feet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"For heaven's sake, give me something to put on!\" I said. I was handed some clothes, \n",
      "but don't ask what: a pair of wool slacks over my pajamas, a red sweater and a black \n",
      "skirt, white understockings and tattered kneesocks. \n",
      "\n",
      "Mrs. van D. sat back down on the chair, and Mr. van D. lay down with his head on \n",
      "my feet. From three- thirty onward I was engrossed in thought, and still shiver- ing \n",
      "so much that Mr. van Daan couldn't sleep. I was preparing myself for the return of \n",
      "the police. We'd tell them we were in hiding; if they were good people, we'd be safe, \n",
      "and if they were Nazi sympathizers, we could try to bribe them! \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We should hide the radio!\" moaned Mrs. van D. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"Sure, in the stove,\" answered Mr. van D. \"If they find us, they might as well find the \n",
      "radio!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Then they'll also find Anne's diary,\" added Father. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"So burn it,\" suggested the most terrified of the group. \n",
      "\n",
      "This and the police rattling on the bookcase were the moments when I was most \n",
      "afraid. Oh, not my diary; if my diary goes, I go too! Thank goodness Father didn't say \n",
      "anything more. \n",
      "\n",
      "There's no point in recounting all the conversations; so much was said. I comforted \n",
      "Mrs. van Daan, who was very frightened. We talked about escaping, being interrogated \n",
      "by the Gestapo, phoning Mr. Kleiman and being courageous. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We must behave like soldiers, Mrs. van Daan. If our time has come, well then, it'll be \n",
      "for Queen and Country, for freedom, truth and justice, as they're always telling us on \n",
      "the radio. The only bad thing is that we'll drag the others down with us!\" \n",
      "\n",
      "After an hour Mr. van Daan switched places with his wife again, and Father came and \n",
      "sat beside me. The men smoked one cigarette after another, an occasional sigh was \n",
      "heard, somebody made another trip to the potty, and then everything began allover \n",

      "They made a list of everything they were planning to tell Mr. Kleiman over the phone, \n",
      "because they intended to call him at seven and ask him to send someone over. They \n",
      "were taking a big chance, since the police guard at the door or in the warehouse \n",

      "Jan and Miep were of course greeted with shouts and tears. Jan nailed a pinewood \n",
      "board over the gap in the door and went off again with Miep to inform the police of \n",
      "the break-in. Miep had also found a note under the ware- house door from Sleegers, \n",
      "the night watchman, who had noticed the hole and alerted the police. Jan was also \n",
      "planning to see Sleegers. \n",
      "\n",
      "So we had half an hour in which to put the house and ourselves to rights. I've never \n",
      "seen such a transformation as in those thirty minutes. Margot and I got the beds \n",
      "ready downstairs, went to the bathroom, brushed our teeth, washed our hands and \n",
      "combed our hair. Then I straightened up the room a bit and went back upstairs. The \n",
      "table had already been cleared, so we got some water, made coffee and tea, boiled the \n",
      "milk and set the table. Father and Peter emptied our improvised potties and rinsed \n",
      "them with warm water and powdered bleach. The largest one was filled to the brim \n",
      "and was so heavy they had a hard time lifting it. To make things worse, it was \n",
      "leaking, so they had to put it in a bucket. \n",
      "\n",
      "At eleven o'clock Jan was back and joined us at the table, and gradually everyone \n",
      "began to relax. Jan had the following story to tell: \n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Sleegers was asleep, but his wife told Jan that her husband had discovered the \n",
      "hole in the door while making his rounds. He called in a policeman, and the two of \n",
      "them searched the building. Mr. Sleegers, in his capacity as night watchman, patrols \n",
      "the area every night on his bike, accompanied by his two dogs. His wife said he would \n",
      "come on Tuesday and tell Mr. Kugler the rest. No one at the police station seemed to \n",
      "\n",
      "know anything about the break-in, but they made a note to come first thing Tuesday \n",
      "\n",
      "morning to have a look. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the way back Jan happened to run into Mr. van Hoeven, the man who supplies us \n",
      "with potatoes, and told him of the break— in. \"I know,\" Mr. van Hoeven calmly replied. \n",
      "\"Last night when my wife and I were walking past your building, I saw a gap in the \n",
      "\n",
      "door. My wife wanted to walk on, but I peeked inside with a flashlight, and that's \n",
      "\n",
      "when the burglars must have run off. To be on the safe side, I didn't call the police. I \n",
      "thought it wouldn't be wise in your case. I don't know anything, but I have my \n",
      "suspicions.\" Jan thanked him and went on. Mr. van Hoeven obviously suspects we're \n",
      "here, because he always delivers the potatoes at lunchtime. A decent man! \n",
      "\n",
      "It was one o'clock by the time Jan left and we'd done the dishes. All eight of us went \n",
      "to bed. I woke up at quarter to three and saw that Mr. Dussel was already up. My \n",
      "face rumpled with sleep, I happened to run into Peter in the bathroom, just after he'd \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "come downstairs. We agreed to meet in the office. I freshened up a bit and went \n",
      "down. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"After all this, do you still dare go to the front attic?\" he asked. I nodded, grabbed \n",
      "my pillow, with a cloth wrapped around it, and we went up together. The weather was \n",
      "gorgeous, and even though the air-raid sirens soon began to wail, we stayed where \n",
      "we were. Peter put his arm around my shoulder, I put mine around his, and we sat \n",
      "quietly like this until four o'clock, when Margot came to get us for coffee. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ate our bread, drank our lemonade and joked (we were finally able to again), and \n",
      "for the rest everything was back to normal. That evening I thanked Peter because he'd \n",
      "been the bravest of us all. \n",
      "\n",
      "None of us have ever been in such danger as we were that night. God was truly \n",
      "watching over us. Just think-the police were right at the bookcase, the light was on, \n",
      "and still no one had discovered our hiding place! \"Now we're done for!\" I'd whispered \n",
      "at that moment, but once again we were spared. When the invasion comes and the \n",
      "bombs start falling, it'll be every man for himself, but this time we feared for those \n",
      "good, innocent Christians who are helping us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\"We've been saved, keep on saving us!\" That's all we can say. \n",

      "\n",
      "to build a bigger, better and more beautiful world, but that they occupy themselves \n",

      "with superficial things, without giving a thought to true beauty. In some passages I \n",

      "adage: \"Every child has to raise itself.\" Parents can only advise their children or point \n",
      "them in the right direction. Ultimately, people shape their own characters. In addition, \n",
      "I face life with an extraordinary amount of courage. I feel so strong and capable of \n",

      "me as a friend, no matter how hard he tries. As a result, I've never shared my \n",

      "would lose that, plus the self-confidence I've worked so hard to achieve, if I were to \n",
      "be subjected to criticism halfway through the job. It may sound hard-hearted, but I \n",
      "can't take criticism from rim either, because not only do I never share my innermost \n",
      "thoughts with him, but I've pushed him even further away by being irritable. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a point I think about quite often: why is it that rim annoys me so much \n",
      "\n",
      "sometimes? I can hardly bear to have him tutor me, and his affection seems forced. I \n",
      "\n",
      "want to be left alone, and I'd rather he ignored me for a while until I'm more sure of \n",

      "around. I created an image of him in my mind, pictured him as a quiet, sweet, \n",
      "sensitive boy badly in need of friendship and love! I needed to pour out my heart to a \n",
      "living person. I wanted a friend who would help me find my way again. I accomplished \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "of Peter. Is he superficial, or is it shyness that holds him back, even with me? But \n",
      "putting all that aside, I made one mistake: I used intimacy to get closer to him, and in \n",
      "doing so, I ruled out other forms of friendship. He longs to be loved, and I can see \n",
      "he's beginning to like me more with each passing day. Our time together leaves him \n",
      "feeling satisfied, but just makes me want to start all over again. I never broach the \n",
      "subjects I long to bring out into the open. I forced Peter, more than he realizes, to \n",
      "get close to me, and now he's holding on for dear life. I honestly don't see any \n",
      "effective way of shaking him off and getting him back on his own two feet. I soon \n",
