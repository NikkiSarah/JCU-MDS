Each word becomes a feature, the value is the count of how many times it occurs in the sample.  Of course, there will be thousands of words in general, so we just choose the N most frequent words as features.  \n",

    "The idea is that if a particular word occurs a lot in two texts, they might be similar. If the same pattern \n",
    "of words is frequent in both, even more so.  However, some words are very frequent in all texts - and, of, \n",
    "is etc - they don't tell you much about what the text is saying; it is common to remove these common \n",
    "words, generally known as *stop words*, before you do any feature extraction.\n",

    "SKLearn has a collection of [text feature extraction](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction) methods that we can make use of. We'll use the simplest of these, [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#common-vectorizer-usage) which just counts the number of times a word occurs in the text.  We pass it a parameter that defines the maximum number of features (words) to use and the name of the stop word list.  \n",
