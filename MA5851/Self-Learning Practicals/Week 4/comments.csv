"March 24, 2002 10:54PM",merc1,"I personally think that with a few tweaks the C320 could also sit at the top of this group. It's still more of a entry-level luxury sedan than Mercedes would lead you to believe. The C320 ""Sport"" needs to have it's suspension retuned to accept 17 inch tires without a harsh ride. MB also needs to stop forcing metal trim and black leather on everyone that wants the sport package. The C240's 6-speed wouldn't hurt either if offered on the C320, though it needs to be ""fixed"" first.

That said, my favorite of the group is (gasp!) the new A4 3.0. The A4 easily has the best interior of any sub-40K car, combine that with stunning looks and a body that is as rigid as any ever made and you have my personal favorite. The single thing I don't like about the A4 is the grey trim around the bottom of the car. This trim doesn't match any of the body colors, as it should be body color anyway. This is an excellent car and in my opinion the best there is under 40K. The upcoming A4 Convertible, Coupe and S4 WILL all be winners.

The BMW 330i is now an old favorite, but I'm (of all people) starting to tire of the 3-Series just a bit, save the M3 variants. I was kind of dissappointed by the 2002 facelift, they could have done a little more in the way of styling. I hope they do a little more for 2003 with the coupe models.

The Acura TL-S is easily my favorite fwd car in this class. Wonderful engine (you actually can hear it) and decent handling for a front driver. Nice price, seats and what not, not hard to see why the TL is so popular. This car's main faults are styling and obvious cost-cutting in the interior, stereo, fake wood etc. Otherwise a standout.

Lexus ES300. Nice, but not my type of car at all. This is one for the Buick set. The IS300 is half baked, but has a wonderful chassis. Styling is also in question here, it simply doesn't look like a 35K car (grown). The interior is gawd-awful. Bet on the next IS300 being done right from the start. In their defense Toyota didn't initially intend for this car to be sold in the U.S. so it was a rush job.

The CTS holds the greatest unrealized potential here. I've seen several now, and each time I see one they look better and better. Again like the C320, IS300 the car has interior issues. The dash feels like it was made by Rubbermaid. If you're going to be stingy with wood trim, why bother? Half of the steering wheel in wood, and very little anywhere else in the car??? The seats are very good though, as is the handling. A work in progress.

The G35 looks like it may have a winning chassis, but the interior, though clean looking seems to be styled about 10 years ago, lots of square shapes and flat surfaces. Another great engine, waiting to drive this one.

Don't really care much for the X-Type. If I were a Jaguar man I'd be truly pissed at Ford and Jaguar for this one. They are actually selling a fwd X-Type in England and I've read where they're thinking about selling it here! Hell no. The car should have been rwd not awd. Some will tell you that this was done to compete with Audi. Thats BS, awd was the only way to keep the car from being fwd, WITHOUT spending the money to convert the car to rwd. It is a good looking car though and that Jaguar ""leaper"" will be enough for some, but this car has to grow on me.

The Chrysler 300M is about as close to an Audi that American cars come. This new 300M ""Special"" is truly a good looking car inside and out. One problem: Where is the performance???? A 255hp car *in this class) with a 0-60 time over 8 seconds is not accpetable. Something is not right here. Some say engine, transmission and/or gearing, but whatever it is, Chrysler needs to let some MB engineers have a look at this car. The heavier E320 with less power is faster. I still like this car, but it's no lust object once you get past the great styling.

"March 25, 2002 12:06AM",fredvh,I am debating a new purchase and these two are at the top of my list. The price difference between these two is approx. 6K (non-Type S Acura). Is the ES300 worth 6K over the TL? I don't know because I have never owned a TL but I am familiar with the ES300(previous generation). Supposedly the 2002 ES300 is a lot better than the previous generation but is it that much better than the TL? Of great importance to me is initial quality and overall dependability. Does the TL compare with the ES300 in both of these categorys? I am not familiar with the Honda Co. Are prices lower than Lexus for service work? I would appreciate any input on this dilemma from some TL owners.
"March 25, 2002 10:02AM",blueguydotcom,"Great handling, RWD, excellent engine and the best warranty around. Easy winner."
"March 25, 2002 4:04PM",hungrywhale,"And no manual tranny. That may not matter to you, but it most certainly does matter to me and many other enthusiast drivers.

So IMO, it's not even on the board, let alone the 'easy winner'."
"March 25, 2002 5:44PM",riez,"One beauty of BMW 3 Series is that there are so many models to choose from. Almost half of all buyers in America don't get the basic RWD 4 door sedan. Besides having 3 engine and 3 transmission choices, you can get coupe, convertible, AWD, station wagon, and super-high performance M-Series!!!

hungrywhale... I concur that having the availability of a manual transmission across the line is absolutely critical!!!"
"March 26, 2002 1:20PM",blueguydotcom,"good grief, so you wait 9 months for the manual. Even with an auto, I prefer to every car listed and I NEVER have owned an auto and never thought I'd enjoy driving a car with an auto. That's what value, performance and an exceptional engine can do for a car. Once the G has a stick there is not another sedan under the M3 that I'd consider."
"March 26, 2002 2:02PM",hungrywhale,"I'll give it a fair shot when the manual comes out, but I'm just flat-out not interested in an auto. I don't care how fast it is. It's not about the speed, it's about the driving experience and having more control over the car."
"March 26, 2002 2:45PM",blueguydotcom,"I understand it's not about the speed. I really don't care if the car won't do over 100 as I rarely break the century mark. What I do care about is power and with the manual mode on the auto, I can get it when I want it. Will I buy an auto-equipped G? In all likelihood, no. I desperately want to drive the 6 speed."
"March 26, 2002 5:00PM",hungrywhale,It sounds like you know why I won't even put it on my list (let alone at the top) until the manual comes out.
"March 26, 2002 7:00PM",riez,"Is there such a thing as an automatic-only true performance sedan? Not in my book. Certainly not in Europe or Asia. Only in America is such an oxymoron possible. Sad.

If or when the manual G35 comes out and the coupe version, then the G35 will be interesting enough to be a serious contender in this segment."
"March 26, 2002 7:55PM",wishnhigh1,"If I had to rank the entry lux performance sedans, here is what I would choose:

Audi A4 3.0(lots of bang for the buck, loads of style and loads of luxury)

Cadillac CTS( Decent BTFB, good handling, non-lemming style)

Infinity G35(Tons of BFTB, good luxury, but completely boring exterior and even more boring of an interior)

BMW 325(very little BFTB, excellent handling/build quality/resale, classy looking but too conservative for me)

SAAB Viggen(almost zero BFTB, spotty build quality, but the damn coolest style in the world).

Everything else is not worth my time"
"March 26, 2002 10:06PM",shipo,"Hey my friend, dig this, in Australia, the ONLY 5-Series that can be had with a manual gearbox is the M5! Yeah, right, not the 525i, 530i, 535i or the 540i, they are all automatic only. :-(

Riez, I read from your profile that you have a manual BMW 5-series. But I think you are wrong to not consider a car such as a Infiniti G35 to be a serious contender as a performance luxury sedan. From your logic, then the BMW 3-series (your wife's) or the 5-series with the Steptronic should not be contenders either. That's belittling the Infiniti, Audi, Lexus, Acuras, BMW's etc. with automatics.

When I return in December from Qatar, I plan on purchasing a sports sedan. I'm leaning on the G35, but the BMW 330i along with the Audi S4 are also contenders. IMO, if the handling of the Infiniti is as good as the BMW as some that drove it has stated, then it will hard to pass up especially for the price. Also my first choice will be a manual, and Infiniti should have the manual out by December. I will test drive all three, manual and automatics, and make my choice from there.

I do agree with you that manuals are more fun to drive, and that will be my first choice. But, automatics in this category, especially those made by BMW, Infiniti and others, should not be eliminated as performance sedans. Different flavors for different people.

I have been following discussions on many boards and what I have been noticing is that there is so many ""experts"" on what is the best sports sedan. And most haven't even driven the competitors to give an honest opinion. This is not aimed at you Riez or Shipko, because your profiles states that you own a BMW already. But from what I noticed is that some BMW ""supportors"" don't even own a BMW, (at least not from their profile) or they state that they never drove an Infiniti G35, but they still make ""unsupported"" facts, assumptions or opinions on such. (See the Edmund's BMW 3-series discussion). I hope in your defense, Reiz, that you drove the automatic Infiniti G35, to give an opinionated statement that it doesn't classify as a performance sedan. I value your opinion and others as well.

Again, I'm not flaming you, but I try to be an informed consumer before I buy anything. That is the reason that I will drive every car that I'm interested in and make my choice from there. I'm also always interested in those opinions from people that own the type of car I'm shopping for and at least drove it, so they can give valid pro/negative statements.

Cheers!"
"March 27, 2002 10:00AM",hungrywhale,"I think what riez and I are trying to say is not that automatics perform poorly or that only weenies drive them

But any car that truly holds itself out as a performance sedan NEEDS at least the option of a manual tranny. Manuals are always faster than automatics and they are almost always the choice of the enthusiast driver.

There's nothing at all wrong with automatics, but I sure don't want one."

"March 27, 2002 11:23AM",dave330i,"In this class, the best bang for the buck has to be IS300, assuming one can live with the styling.

I guess I'm one of the few that likes the old A4 styling to the new. Isn't the new A4 pushing 3600 lbs. now? That's pretty heavy for this class."
"March 27, 2002 12:06PM",blueguydotcom,"Even at 29k for a 35k msrp IS300, I passed on it. Now I never drove a manual one (they weren't out yet) but even with a manual, given the car's horrible drive-feel, poor interior and lethargic steering, I don't think I'd go near one. They're not up to Audi/BMW/MB/Infiniti."
"March 27, 2002 1:42PM",wishnhigh1,"Never liked a lexus, and probably never will. I would rather drive the CTS. There is always something that irritates me about them. I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus...I personally think Lexus should have a car in its lineup with this cheap of an interior and with this much sporting character. Toyota deserves something like it though.

Also, I don't think 215 horsepower for 29k is a lot of bang for the buck, considering the G35 is the same price with 260 horsies."
"March 27, 2002 1:46PM",dave330i,"""I would buy the IS as a Toyota but not a Lexus""

How else are they going to get that extra $5k from you then?

Reasonably equipped G35 goes for $33k or so."
"March 27, 2002 2:10PM",riez,"I couldn't have said it better myself. I'll let you lead services!

mbarto... I most certainly will test a G35 manual if and when it finally comes out. I promise!!! Automatics make nice luxury sedans and maybe even sporty luxury sedans. But NOT performance sedans or luxury performance sedans. (I don't even consider the 540iA Sport truly worthy, though it is as close as one can get in an automatic. If I could just get my wife to drive a manual....)"
"March 28, 2002 12:43AM",mbarto,"Thanks Riez! Let me know when you do. I'm sure you'll get a chance before I will since I won't return until December. I am curious of how it compares to the BMW's. YOU can speak from experience, so I'll value your opinion.

It does make a difference being married. (LOL! see the latest discussions on the Infiniti G35 vs BMW 330i board). First, I'm fortunate to have a wife that can drive a manual. Not that she prefers that, her first choice is an automatic. But she appreciates the hard work and sacrifice I'm doing out here, and knows that this car is for me first, family second. Of course, it helps my cause when I let her buy a new dining room set last month, and new living room drapes this month. Bribes do help! Whatever I finally decide, I'm sure she'll be happy."
"March 28, 2002 5:07PM",riez,"mbarto... As regards the ""bribes"" issue, you've figured out one of life's great truism: You get what you want so I can get what I want."""
"April 5, 2002 3:34PM",cybersol,"So if someone were looking to purchase a new performance luxury sedan today, what cars would they HAVE to take a look at and test drive? Lets say they only had time to look at five?

What five would they have to look into?"
"April 5, 2002 5:16PM",riez,"Since it has to have a manual transmission and should be RWD (AWD/4WD adds too much weight and complexity) and has to be fun to drive hard...

1. BMW 3 Series manual
2. Lexus IS300 manual
3. Cadillac CTS manual
4. Lincoln LS6 manual

If you want affordable and can go FWD, then add Nissan Maxima 6-speed with LSD and maybe Altima 3.5SE 5-speed.

Try to get car with LSD. Inline 6s are magnificently smooth engines.

Possible future car: Infiniti G35 sedan when it finally gets the 6-speed manual."
"April 7, 2002 8:22AM",coolguyky7,"The TL should be up for redesign in a few years so a TL would be outdated in the not so far future. And besides, it seems like everyone who drives an Acura drives the TL. I LOVE the ES300. Some say it looks bloated; I don't think it does. At the 3/4 angle, it looks impressive. The interior is as nice as a car can get. If I had the money, I would buy an ES300 in a heartbeat. I never did like the past ones' boring styling...especially since the last two generations were nearly twins. Go with the ES. Besides, Lexus' quality is ahead of Acura's."
"April 7, 2002 3:59PM",kdshapiro,"The new ES is a very smart looking car. Notwithstanding any engine issues though, I think there are direct price competitors like the I35 that offer better overall value on paper. Now I haven't driven either new model, I did drive the older ES300 and it did it's job very well. They are both great cars. Lexus for legendary reliability and resale value, Infiniti for up-to-date features."
"April 8, 2002 3:32PM",blueguydotcom,"Um...you left off the Infiniti G35 and it's bland, boring brother the I35 (the ES300's competition).

"April 9, 2002 2:12PM",jagboyxkr,"Sorry, I thought that I had already taken up too much space, and I also was getting tired of typing. When I check out an Infiniti G35, maybe I'll post something on it.

I always thought the I35's looked all right, even if they aren't the most exciting cars ever built."
"April 9, 2002 2:43PM",blueguydotcom,"Go drive one. They're a blast and for the money they're a steal. If someone wants entry level performance luxury at a great price, the G's really tough to beat.

Save for BMW, it sort of stands head and shoulders over most of its competition."
"April 11, 2002 3:06PM",steffie2jc,"I can't make a decision. I was set on the MB C240 but then I read some postings from people who got lemons. Now I am starting to think that the Audi 3.0 CVT front wheel drive is what I shoud get. Any advice? Low manintenance is what I am looking for.
Thanks!"
"April 12, 2002 7:53AM",merc1,"Well I'm a Benz fan first and foremost, but the A4 3.0 CVT just offers more for the money. The A4 has a better interior, the top A4 engine (compared to the C240, which is the base C) and it's styling is at least as good as the Benz if not better. Both makes pay for scheduled maint during the warranty period. Neither car will be ""low maintanence"" after the warranty runs out, especially the Audi with it's fairly different transmission. If you're priced these cars and they've come out equal go for the Audi it's the better value here.

M"
"April 14, 2002 1:09AM",popovs,"I think both are excellent(sp?) cars, however neither one is a low maintenance automobile. That is to say neither brand is known for low maintenance. What they do offer is luxury and performance in an aesthetically pleasing package and, some would argue, a superior ownership experience.

As someone has said before, every manifacturer makes lemons - some more than others - but the internet is not the best place to find information about that. Most people are just venting and are not representative of the owner community.

Although I can not speak as to the driving merits of the cars, I suspect that they are similar since I've heard (read) good things about both the A4 CVT and the C240. Something to keep in mind is that anytime a new product is offered by the industry, it usually takes a couple of years for the company to work out all the bugs in the technology.

Both cars are relative newcommers to the market. The facts that they are made by distinguished companies and use proven powerplants does not speak conclusively as to how reliable the cars will be as a whole.

Since you are already looking for alternatives to the MB because of reliability concerns, it may be worth your time to look at other alternatives than the Audi. As someone has suggested in the Help me Choose! forum, try looking to Lexus for the answer. They seem to make reliable cars that are also cheap to keep running. Of course now we get into the issue of European vs Asian luxury ..."
"April 17, 2002 2:23AM",popovs,"It has come to my attention that as of late MB has taken a hit in its reputation. People have been quick to point at the recent survey results - both European and Domestic - that say Mercedes is no longer reliable. These surveys show that statistically speaking MB has as much as doubled the amount of repairs that they do under warranty. I won't deny these findings, but I will try and justify them.

1st and foremost, MB has and is comming out with newer designs every year, updating the cars both inside and out. Anytime that a new product makes its debue it takes a couple of tries to get all the kinks worked out.

Secondly, according to mbspy.com, Mercedes accounted for ~half of the profits by DCX last year. I think MB is being used as a cash cow to keep Jeep and Co affloat, thereby driving Mercedes to cost-cutting through corparate pressure. Lower quality parts equal lower overall car quality.

These two should get things going ... Feel free to agree or disagree."
"April 17, 2002 12:37PM",mvargo1,"There is not much to debate on this subject. If you want a reliable car you buy Japanese. If you want a drivers car you used to have to buy european. The Japanese just do quality better and more consistantly than anyone else. You also get a lot more car for your money with a Japanese vehicle. There was a time when the europeans built the best driving cars in the world. Sadly for them those days are passing. The Japanese keep building cars that are closer and closer to european driving dynamics (IS and GS series Lexus(Lexi?), and Q45 and G35 Infiniti's) While the europeans quality especially Daimler/Chrysler just is not keeping up."
"April 17, 2002 1:11PM",wishnhigh1,gave up nationality based generalizations a couple of years ago.
"April 18, 2002 4:12PM",cybersol,"I'm interested more towards performance than luxury. Also value is an important component for me. Although I have the money to buy these cars, I also have other fun things and places to spend it. I'm looking to buy the car and keep it for around 7-10 years. Its very sunny with no snow here as well. I also want an automatic or CVT(gasp).

So right now, the five I am going to look at more closely are as follows:

1) BMW 330i
2) Audi A4 3.0 CVT
3) Infiniti G35
4) Acura TL-S
5) Nissan Altima 3.5 SE

The BMW represents the top of the class, but it also has the highest price. The Altima represents the most performance oriented family car, which is a cheaper class of cars. The BMW and Altima will bracket the value equation. The other three all have the potential to compete for my dollars.

Cars that are missing, IS300 too small, while the styling of the CTS, S60 T5, and 9-5 Aero are not for me. The ES300 and I35 don't have enough performance for me. Everything more expensive than a comparibly equipped 330i was also excluded.

What do you guys think? Anything missing?

Thanks,

"April 18, 2002 4:50PM",riez,"cybersol... I can't fathom why you would want to go with slushbox, but that is your loss.

Comparing FWD to RWD is like apples to oranges.

Not sure what sort of real price range you are looking at. The 330i with options might push $40,000. You might really consider the much less expensive 325i. An Altima 3.5SE with few options might have a $25,000 MSRP.

Read Motor Trend's review of I35. Their's had more than enough performance. 0-60 mph in 7.0 seconds, fastest in their comparison test. And it can be had with a Sport Package. But you might be better off with a loaded Maxima SE or GLE, saving thousands off the I35.

You might also consider Volkwagen Passat. That can also be had with AWD. If you like AWD, the Jag X-type should be on your list.

From the domestic corner, you might also consider a Lincoln LS 6 or 8. Or Chrysler 300M.

Surprised your list excludes the Mercedes-Benz C-class.

And if you can live with a FWD automatic, a loaded Camry or Accord V-6 or Avalon might be acceptable near the Altima's price range."
"April 18, 2002 6:07PM",cybersol,"Sorry to disappoint with the slushbox, but if we were all the same life would be boring (and there would only be 1 car type).

I would prefer RWD, but the best FWD's (torque sensitive steering) are getting close enough to bring the acceptable price premium for RWD down. Price range is 25-40K as you mention.

Passat, 300M, 325i, are too slow for me. The C Classes are either too slow or more expensive than the BMW. I would choose the BMW over the X-type, as they are similarly priced and I live in sun country.

The maxima (better value than the I35) is a good suggestion, and I am considering that equally with the Altima at the lower end.

My wife loves Camry's, but I'm looking for excitement. slushbox or not.

Thanks,
cybersol"
"April 18, 2002 7:14PM",kdshapiro,"The new Altima is great as my friends just bought one. However, dollar for dollar I think the Maxima is the over-all winner for a FWD car. If you can live without the amenities of the I35 the GLE with leather, sunroof, BOSE can't be beat. I've owned two Maximas. Me! I recently made the jump to the 330i, and it's been worth every penny. However the G35 owners are very passionate about their choices. For a couple of dollars more than the Maxima, hovering around the I35 I guess, the TL-S can't be beat either.

I understand when it comes down to it, you pick what you think has the right combination of value, performance, luxury and the right type of car for you. For every person it is different. When I got the BMW I was cross-shopping SUVs, mini-vans, and FWD passenger cars to see what struck my fancy, and I was ready to get an Explorer."
"April 18, 2002 7:18PM",riez,"cybersol... Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible. I can't get too excited about FWDers. Certainly not a slushbox FWDer.

Not sure what you mean about ""the best FWDers (torque sensitive steering)"".

Very powerful FWDers tend to suffer from severe torque steering. Use of equal length half-shafts and limited slip differential can help, but not completely eliminate. The laws of physics remain. When the drive wheels and steering wheels are one and the same, and you have a powerful motor, you'll get some torque steering.

Do you have kids? Plan to in near future? If not, have you considered any coupes or convertibles? They can be a bit more exciting."
"April 19, 2002 8:28AM",dave330i,"""Excitement and slushbox don't seem to be compatible.""

Agreed. Unfortunately, most American drivers don't seem to get it. They care about silly stuff like 0-60, 1/4 mile, hp & torque numbers, but choose to miss out on the fun part of driving."
"April 20, 2002 1:18AM",cybersol,"Riez, you have heard of speed sensitive steering? This varies the power steering boost as with the speed. Acura claims to have torque sensitive power steering on the TL-S (not the TL though). This would supposedly vary the power steering boost with the torque being applied. And that in theory could eliminate a large amount of torque steer found in powerful FWD cars. It still doesn't eliminate the FWD tendency to under steer due the the drive wheels being the same as the turning wheels."
"April 20, 2002 9:49AM",riez,"cybersol... There are two types. Those tied to engine output and those tied to road speed. I have heard that the latter are superior, since you can vary engine speeds (RPMs) a lot, depending upon gear being used and speed, even while driving relative steady speeds. Better systems vary boost on road speed, since you normally need more assist at low speeds, regardless of engine RPMs.

Here is all that the lengthy full-color TL brochure says: ""Steering: Variable Power-Assist Rack-and-Pinion"". This is off the tech specs on page 30. I cannot find a single mention of the steering system anywhere else in the brochure. So if Acura thinks its variable assist power steering system is special, they are keeping it a secret. This large brochure covers both the TL and TL Type S."
"April 21, 2002 12:36AM",cybersol,"Yeah, I have that brouchure and they don't mention the difference between the TL and TL-S, though they say both have variable power assist. They do not say how it varies.

But on the Acura website. TL -> Specifications -> Body/Suspension/Chassis it says:


Steering Type

TL Type S - Torque-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering

3.2TL - Speed-sensitive, variable power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering


Here's the link if you want to check it out:

http://www.acura.com/model_TL/tl_spec_results.asp


Hard to find, but not a secret."
"April 21, 2002 6:50AM",riez,"cybersol... From what I've read, the better variable power assist system is tied to road speed, not engine RPMs. Once you get a car up to 25 mph or more, there isn't much need for assist, even if your RPMs decline due to turning or downshifting. And certainly once you hit 45 mph or more there isn't much need for assist no matter what happens to your RPMs.

But keep in mind that torque steering isn't due to the steering system. It is due to other factors. Can be very pronounced in powerful FWDers. Corrective actions include limited slip differentials and equal half-shafts. Need to provide equal power simultaneously to drive wheels.

From standing start, floor your car. See if the wheel pulls in one direction. You'll have to correct with the steering wheel (to keep the car straight) but by then you'll have already encountered the torque steering. You can also notice it if you are aggressively accelerating in a curve. Wheels pull you out of your intended direction and you have to correct."
"April 24, 2002 7:51AM",beartrax79,"So, if you read through most of this group, alot of references went out to Audi... give a guy a hand here and compare an Audi A4 3.0 to an Audi S4... I see a difference of about $5K, 30hp, and a sporty suspension. Why shouldn't I load up a 3.0, rather than going after the S4?

Oh, and does anyone know on possible improvements for one or the other for 2003?"
"April 24, 2002 5:15PM",cybersol,"Have you driven them both? The S4 really moves. Even by Audi's own 0-60 times the S4 manual is 1 second faster and the S4 tiptronic is 1.2 seconds faster.

Yet, the S4 is currently based on the 2001 A4 platform, and it is scheduled to be upgraded to the new platform in the 2003 model year. Expect the performance difference to increase as the indications are that the new S4 will pack 300 or more hp.

Hope this helps."
"April 25, 2002 12:36PM",beartrax79,"I've tested the 3.0, not the S4. Hmmm... new S4 in '03, huh? Maybe I should just wait. What do you think, cybersol? Right now, th3 current S4 states 250hp, yes?"
"April 26, 2002 9:50AM",cybersol,"Yeah, the current S4 has 250 hp and 258 lb-ft of torque. The torque is fully online by 1850 rpm. So this is why it scoots.

The new S4 should be really nice. If you have the time to wait, it might be worth seeing. It might move up in price a little if the performance gets closer to the BMW M3, but then the old S4's should be easier to pick up at a good price right as the new ones are coming out. So many decisions.

Have fun making the right one for you!"
"April 27, 2002 2:37PM",1pierce,"Not so fast. There is merit to the ""nationality based"" debate. Let me explain to you why Japanese cars have higher quality (in terms of reliability) than American or European cars. The reason is cultural.

Americans have always had an adventurous, entrepreneurial spirit. We take chances. Its not in our nature to ""accept"" things as they are. I think this is somewhat genetic, since the vast number of us are descended from immigrants - aren't we all, really - people who took tremendous risk, and had great courage to brave the unknown for the promise of a new and better life. As such, in areas of design, we bore very easily. Americans are always looking for the next great thing, the next new design, the next technology breakthrough. Europeans, especially Germans, are like this about cars, if not about everything else. The US auto industry is always ready to chuck the old and start over from scratch - witness Chrysler and Ford over the last two decades. As such, our products are usually stylish and inventive, but not very refined - see minivans, SUV's, cab-forward, night-vision, etc..

The Japanese by comparison have a culture that is traditional and thousands of years old. They have made an entire culture out of honoring tradition and the status quo. We had to yank them kicking and screaming into the 20th century after world war II. I know this is somewhat simplistic, but bear with me. What the Japanese are good at is taking an idea and refining it year after year, until it is near perfect. There is very little innovation or risk taking. That is why the cars are so bland. When was the last time you saw a new technology invented in Japan? VCR's, computer technology, cell phones, the microwave oven...all American inventions that are better built by the Japanese. The same goes for cars. Most innovations come from the US or Germany, with some safety innovations coming from Scandinavia (give up the turbos and 5-cylinders, already those are as refined as they're going to get!).

Anyway,...when you distill it down to its essence, this is why Toyotas and Hondas never break. Its also why they are no more than transportation appliances. And, this is why the best performance cars from Japan will always be knock-offs (albeit sometimes very good ones) of something somebody else does better and more originally.

I'll step off my soap box now, and await your wailing."
"April 27, 2002 2:54PM",wishnhigh1,"The problem is that they are HUGE generalizations. Also, you are talking Japanese as almost exclusivly Honda and Toyota. What about Subaru, Mazda, Isuzu, Mitsubishi, Daihatsu, and Suzuki? So far the only makes that seem to keep with that Japanese Culture are Toyota and Honda.

And many American and European makes are now capable of having higher quality than more than 70% of Japanese cars. Doesn't help your generalization that much, does it?

So where do the generalizations stop? They should stop with brands, and not nations."
"April 27, 2002 7:38PM",kd6aw1,"Have found out that with some of the more powerful cars like the G35 or Corvette the difference in performance from a practical standpoint isn't really an issue because these cars are faster than we can ever dream of driving without either killing ourselves or getting tickets all the time. I have an automatic G35 and love it. Being that it is an automatic I can enjoy my coffee, shave, talk on my cel phone and hug my wife while driving in rush hour traffic. If I feel the urge which I don't very often I can shift the manumatic and pretend it is a stick. When I get my Ferrari it will have the paddle shifting because I don't ever want another clutch!

====================================

Those cars in general reflect the perfectionist attitude of 1pierce's post. With virtually no exception, the overall quality of Japanese brand cars, especially fit and finish, considerably excels the American brands. From what I have read, this is due to the attitude of Japanese management in not accepting mediocre craftsmanship. Not the abilities of the assembly line workers. You may have a point though, that some of the Japanese brands show as high a level of innovation as the American and German brands. After all, which country has used the Wankle rotary, and Miller cycle engines? And who introduced us to the VTEC engines etc?

American management leans strongly to the bottom line and CEO bonuses, with refinement and polish falling by the wayside as a casuality of the heavy handed management style."

"May 23, 2002 10:18AM",blueguydotcom,But it's not really a performance sedan. Drive one and then take on a Bimmer or G35. Night and day. VWs are nice inside and good for cruising but their handling's akin to riding a pig in a hurry.
"May 28, 2002 7:50AM",rayainsw,"I beg to differ.

While I admit that I am biased (obviously, since I bought one!) I believe that the W8 is really a performance sedan.

I test drove the G35, and several BMWs (and a few others) before making my final choice. I suppose the term &#145;performance sedan&#146; could be defined in any number of ways. For me, the W8 offers everything I want &#150; and nothing I don&#146;t.

(Isn&#146;t that a recent Nissan &#145;tag line&#146;?)

Take straight line acceleration, for instance. VW literature quotes 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec. To me, this is pretty quick for a 4 door sedan. My fearless (?) prediction of future test acceleration numbers is: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.5 sec., as VW claims. And a quarter mile in about 15.0 at 94 / 95. I base this on a number of things. For instance, in the May 2000 Car and Driver comparison that included the Lincoln LS8 Sport and the Audi A6 2.7TT, the Audi tested had virtually identical curb weight as the W8, identical final drive, wheel / tire size and Tiptronic. The HP / TQ for this Audi were 250 / 258. And their test results were: 0 &#150; 60 in 6.6 sec. and the quarter mile in 15.1 at 94. Thus, my W8 with 270 / 273 ought to do slightly better. We&#146;ll see. . . (BTW: in the same test, the Lincoln LS8 Sport they tested turned in acceleration numbers of: 0 &#150; 60 in 7.5 and the quarter mile in 15.7 at 90. This was my previous car. So, it seems reasonable that my W8 feels quicker &#150; setting aside the notorious un-reliability of everyone&#146;s &#145;butt dyno&#146;!)

Does it pull the same lateral G as the G35 or a BMW 3 series w/Sport Package. Almost certainly no. But with more aggressive rubber, I expect that it will provide enough grip for entertainment value at any sane public road speed.

Just my opinions.

"June 4, 2002 12:13PM",cmnott,"I recently went through the list of entry level cars...I was in test drive heaven!

325i - very nice car, best shifter/clutch of all, but not enough power for me. Great motor though as fas as smoothness. the interior is average, nothing better. With leather and wood it helps but you either dig it or you don't.

330i - same as above but better power, although I find the power to be linear. You can really move in this car but the sensation of thrust is lacking. I like that sunroof and leather are std. Better value overall than 325i plus std. 17"" wheels (although with all-seasons). Pricy.

IS300- Nice manual tranny and smooth motor. That's about it. hate the interior, feels claustrophobic and chintzy.

X-Type - I liked the 3.0L Sport, but did not like the grey stained maple. Didn't look like a jag. Very nearly purchased a 3.0L British Racing Green with Ivory Leather and beautiful walnut but with options this car is riciulously overpriced, makes the BMW look like a bargain hunter. Too bad, nice motor and very good manual tranny and ride. Brakes were strong. One thing about the motor was it just didn't feel or go like 0-60 6.5 as advertised. Nicest interior overall.

A4 3.0 - Porky, ponderous even with sport package. Did not feel swift and easily the worst tranny available in this segment. Nice interior, leather was only average. you could barely tell the difference between the leather and leatherette, which is a good thing if you are cheap, but bad if you opt for leather. By the way, the leather in the BMW was much better.

S4 (2001)- Nice but not as fast as I thought it would be (I did drive a 99 Mustang GT). It rockets off the line but it isn't that impressive afterwards. Nicer seats and support but interior is too gloomy. 250bhp and 258 lb ft. motor is not an audible delight, the 2002 A4 3.0 sounds amazing compared to the S4. I think the backpressure has gobbled up the exhaust note. An exhaust would be perfect here. They were giving them away (9000$ off MSRP - and people were definitely buying!) but it just looked dated now beside the new ones.

G35 - went and looked at one in showroom and was not impressed and without a manual tranny, I wasn't interested one bit. I still managed to drive one and was impressed with the torque, it definitely had thrust that the others lacked (except the S4). Nice seats and neat touches for rear passengers. I really liked the dynamics of the car but the tranny left me cold. The fit and finish was poor, maybe it was an early model...no dicker sticker which made it cost as much as the A4 3.0 and BMW 330i was close.

Lincoln LS V6 - very good handling and crisp 5 speed. Engine was thrashy at high revs which is particularly bad because it needs to be revved to really move. Torque is lacking here. But I liked the car overall, especially with the Sport susp.

Acura TL-S, another auto tranny but an incredible motor, definitely my favourite V6 of all of them as far as sound is concerned. Interior average and handling so-so. Excellent price.

Volvo S60 T5 - I chose this car for its thrust (come to think of it 3bhp less and 15 lb.ft less than the S4 is quite close to the S4, and it is lighter) FWD torque steer is evident only beyond 8/10ths, but it is there, no question about it. Best seats, best stereo, average steering feel falls behind the Jaguar and BMW. Brakes while strong are grabby but it takes getting used to. Amazing power and style. Seems decent off the line but after 100km/h it easily pulls the hardest. Price was also a consideration as it was cheaper than BMW, Audi, Jaguar.

Didn't drive the CTS but I am sure it is excellent.

In conclusion these are all excellent cars and even though we all nitpick this and that on all of them, I would be fine with any of them in my driveway. Honestly."
"June 4, 2002 2:27PM",blueguydotcom,"I had the grave misfortune to drive a CTS, and it's not in the same league as the Bimmer, Audi, Infiniti or even the lesser Acura/Lexus/Jag.

The CTS i drove was a 5 speed sport model with a sticker of 38k (gasp!). The tranny was rough, very rough, almost Mustang bad. The interior felt cheap with lots of hard plastic and very little in the way of substantial or soft-touch materials. The throttle response was weak and required excessive modulation of a rather awkward gas pedal. The car's a rolling bed of 1998 technology, no automatic brake distribution for one thing. The salesmen kept insisting 4 channel ABS is impressive...to each his own. Handling? Nothing at all like the claims car mags are making. It was a slow reacting boat...turn the wheels, feel the car undulate and then slowly shift directions. Not impressive in the least. In fact when the salesguy asked me what I thought after the drive I told him the CTS wasn't even a real competitor to the germans or japanese. He snorted and reminded me, ""This is a caddy, not a sports car."" Yeah, well that Caddy can sit on the lot with the other heaps they have."

"June 5, 2002 8:11AM",cmnott,"Hey blueguy, what wrond with the Mustang tranny! I know it is not a FWD type gearbox but when you have 300 lb.ft. of torque twisting that car, you need a strong tranny. In all honesty, the clutch, while incredibly easy to modulate was hevay, but with a purpose. never missed a gear either, which can't be said about the A4 6-speed...

jagboyxkr, I know you have an X-Type and I was right in there to the end with this car. Bottom line was 10000CDN difference. The way they package the options is ridiculous. i needed the split fold seats, but they were bundled in a $2000 package. Xenons? Twice asmuch as any other car, $1600.00. Sunroof? another 1600.00. It was unbeleivable but the lease rate was very low (1.9%) which helped make up the difference.

I don't care what anybody says about the X-Type, because most have never driven them, it is IMO, a better overall car than the Audi. In Canada, AWD is recommended...this car gets slaughtered because of its high price. This car should have been priced equal to the leader of the class, but to price it more than the best car in the segment is suicide in this hot market.

The T5 is broken in nicely, I have over 2000 miles on it now and it is everything I expected. What i didn't expect was the sheer power this thing has after 100km'h. I think it would beat my Mustang at that speed in a rolling start, no question. i would even say an S4..."

Cmnott, I respect your opinion about the jag and the audi 3.0...although I strongly disagree. I guess as a 3.0 owner I would. I personally found the jag x-type to be the worst car I have ever test driven. First, it was $3000 more than the Audi. Second, well it is a ford and felt like a ford. The handling in no way compared to the 3.0. The interior might ""look"" a little better but certainly did not ""feel"" any better. AS for performance, I am a little dissapointed with th 3.0 and I think they could have used a 250-260 hp engine to solve the problems. However, it is still a fun engine...especially at highway speeds. I honetsly felt that the Mondeo (excuse me, x-type) was going to fall apart on my test drive.

Now I know Audi has had its problems but not even close to comparison with the negative headlines for the x-type!

Oh well...to each their own! Enjoy your T5!!!"
"June 27, 2002 9:10PM",jagboyxtype,"I came to a different conclusion about the Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 and the Audi A4 3.0 Quattro. I was considering both vehicles, and it was very close, but the Jaguar won for me.

ACCELERATION:
In acceleration times, the Jaguar is clearly faster than the Audi. Car&Driver states of the X-TYPE, ""Subjectively, the X-TYPE didn't feel quite as quick as a BMW 330i. But a few instrumented acceleration runs revealed that the measured 0-to-60-mph time of 6.3 seconds was only 0.2 seconds slower than the small BMW. We would rate the smoothness of the X-TYPE's V-6 to be similarly close to that of the Bavarian in-line six.""

Road&Track says of the X-TYPE's performance, ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distant exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, the Mercedes C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BMW 330i's time.""

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 acceleration times: 6.3 - 6.5 sec*.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro acceleration time: 7.1 sec*.

* = manual transmission.

HANDLING:
Of how the cars handle, R&T says of the X-TYPE, ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkietalkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves!' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either. Our test car's optional 3.0-liter 4-cam V-6 (there's a less expensive 2.5 version as well) put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort.""

They also say of its suspension, ""Jaguar engineers told us they wanted the suspension to be 'connected but relaxed,'and that seems to wrap it up nicely. The ride is about as smooth as you'll find in this class, even with the Sport suspension. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivers surprisingly good handling.""

Of the Audi's handling, they say, ""Dynamically, the all-wheel-drive car is not as crisp as it looks. It handles well enough and has a superb highway ride, but it accomplishes these goals in a rather soft and rubbery style of suspension tuning and steering...In short, the Audi is missing that firm, rally-car edge and sense of steering precision that makes the BMW, for instance, so delightful to drive. It's a car that can keep up with the other sports sedans, but doesn't feel very sporty doing it, despite our car's having the optional sport suspension for $750...We noticed in some of the whoop-de-dos and curves of our desert highway that the Audi produced 'considerable excitement,' as one driver put it, and was simply more floaty and loose than the others. And again, 'This is where you pay for that great highway ride,' one driver noted. The 3.0-liter 220-bhp dohc aluminum V-6 is smooth and reasonably peppy, though well back from the front of this pack.""

STEERING:
Motor Trend says of the X-TYPE's ZF Servotronic II variable-ratio speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion steering system, ""The car's best system may be its speed-sensitive rack-and-pinion power steering. In fact, it matches the previously unrivaled precision served up by BMW 3 Series. Car placement feels laser-guided precise, with excellent feedback and road feel. With complete confidence and comfort, we drove at most times with just our fingertips - even at 120 mph on the track. The only all-wheel-drive car we've ever driven offering similar levels of steering communication is the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a pretty racy piece.""

The Audi's steering was criticized again by Car & Driver and Road & Track for being, ""rubbery"" in feeling, and C&D said that the ""steering wheel vibrates at peak engine revs.""

Car&Driver also says that the steering system of the X-TYPE ""is nothing short of terrific."" They call it ""enthusiast goods"".

Forbes even takes note of the steering system in the X, ""Jaguar engineers boast it's the best steering system they've ever had on any model. We agree.""

ALL-WHEEL-DRIVE:
Audi is known for its Quattro AWD system, which has been develped for over 22 years now. Quattro IV its newest version, and is used on the A4. It divides power 50/50 to the front and rear wheels unless slip is detected, and is known to be one of the best systems available. Torque steer is said to be very minor, and it is said to work well with even the turbocharged 1.8-liter 4-cylinder versions of the A4, although it is noted by some to feel heavy without the larger V6. Audi also used Quattro to prove that AWD in certain racing conditions could be better than other setups, and later was banned from using AWD cars in certain races because of its advantages.

Jaguar uses a new AWD system they designed called Traction 4, which divides torque 40% to the front wheels, and 60% to the rear unless slip is detected. This, along with specially designed roller bearings fitted between the tops of the front strut towers and the body, along with its advanced steering mechanism, give the performance and feel of a RWD car. Unlike most AWD systems, Car&Driver said that Traction 4 produces no torque steer to interphere with the purity of the steering.

Forbes stated of the X-TYPE's AWD, ""The X-TYPE gets a seemless, virtually transparent new 40/60 viscous coupling all-wheel-drive system with optional dynamic stability control that rivals Audi's vaunted Quattro for wet- and dry- weather grip.""

Road&Track said that, ""...The Jag is better balanced. It will understeer during turn-in, take something of a set, and then pull you through. It's a safe and secure feeling that signals what's about to happen and gives you plenty of time to adjust""

BRAKING:
The X-TYPE features the same vented front and solid rear discs as found on the larger S-TYPE.

Road & Track said, ""In braking tests, the X-TYPE had impressive and easily repeatable stopping distances from 60 mph (118 ft.) and 80 mph (208 ft.)"" In another one of their articles, they say, ""The braking distances turned by the X-TYPE are exceptional, comparable to those of top sports cars.""

Car & Driver also said, ""A few laps at the Castle Combe racetrack allowed us to explore the outer reaches of the X-TYPE's handling, where it proved completely benign, thanks to the all-wheel-drive. Even at the limit, understeer never grinds the front tires excessively, but the only way to get the tail out was to flick the steering wheel while simultaneously lifting the throttle. The four-wheel disc brakes proved linear and powerful under repeated heavy track use.""

By comparison, a BMW M-Roadster stops from 60 mph in the same 118 feet as the Jag. The Porsche 911 GT2 stops from 60 just two feet shorter than the Jag, at 116 feet. An SLK32 AMG does"
"June 27, 2002 9:10PM",jagboyxtype,"it in 127 feet.

-Jaguar X-TYPE 3.0 braking distance from 60 mph: 118 ft.
-Audi A4 3.0 Quattro braking distance from 60 mph: 137 ft.

ITERIOR:
Here is where the statements become subjective, and anything I say here other than what is quoted from others is just my opinion.

Both the Audi and the Jaguar offer excellent interiors. The Jaguar goes for the warm-looking British cabin that its family members also display, utilizing massive amounts of wood and Conolly leather with bits of chrome; the Audi has a German, functional design that is still inviting with clean lines and details. I really like the interiors of both cars. The Jaguar has the best leather and wood, but a few things like the plastic of the Audi's air vents seems more resilient, etc.

Road&Track said that, ""Despite the lower-than-XJ price, the X-TYPE sports the traditional Jaguar upscale cabin...The simple round gauges have an easy-on-the-eyes green backing on the instrument faces, there's birds-eye maple trim scattered around the cockpit, and the seats are tasteful and comfortable...The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges."" They say it ""may be an 'entry level' model, but you wouldn't know it judging by all that leather, wood, and the easy to use nav system.""

Motor Trend says the X-TYPE ""has great styling inside and out"", and says specifically that the interior is ""soothing, luxurious, and reasonably sound from an ergonomic standpoint. The main instruments are nicely detailed and easily readable through the steering wheel. HVAC and audio-system controls are housed in a centrally mounted horseshoe-shaped binnacle, which allows lots of genuine maple veneer to span the entire dash...It's pure Jag inside and out.""

Car&Driver says ""As you'd expect, the interior is lined in sumptuous Connolly leather and bird's-eye maple wood trim on the dashboard and doors. Luxury amenities abound, as well as the expected front, side, and head airbags...The level of finish is very nice with neat stitiching, close fits, and excellent materials throughout.""
_____________________________

eaweg-

My opinion is that the Audi and the Jaguar are both great cars, but that the Jaguar offers more. It is more expensive than the A4, but it is more expensive for a reason. It is known to outhandle the A4 and outperform it in acceleration and braking, and it has the most rigid chassis in its class, 30% more than the previous class leader. AWD is also standard, as well as Connolly leather and wood. You must have had a bad test car if yours felt like it was going to fall apart, because everything I have read and experienced with the X-TYPE says that it is very solid with high-quality materials throughout. Like you said, to each their own."
"June 27, 2002 11:54PM",blueguydotcom,you can lease an X-type for next to nothing...high incentives.
"June 28, 2002 6:02AM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the sametime I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs? )
Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35. I was really interested in the x-type whenit came out. It does look quite beautiful. Howerver, I test drove not only one but two. Same opinion. Both felt like fast wheelbarrows. I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type. The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision. I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal. My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well. I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should). Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems. Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none. What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...

""Quality problems bedevil Jaguar's X-Type; two drivetrain issues cited""

...Jaguar Cars Ltd. is at risk of alienating its newest group of owners, many of whom complain their new X-Type sedans have an array of irritating quality snafus. While none of the problems directly affect safety or operation, they are of sufficient annoyance that some first-time Jaguar buyers say they're ready to bolt the franchise...

...There are two separate drivetrain problems. During deceleration from about 70 mph, a high-pitched whine will come from the all-wheel-drive differential unit. That problem is so widespread that Jaguar has issued a technical service bulletin to its U.S. dealers.

The fix: adding mass to the differential-mounting bracket.

But the cold weather noise is another matter. It occurs anywhere from 20 mph to 70 mph. For some owners it goes away quickly; others have the tuning-fork sound ringing for minutes at a time.

This problem has been the most bothersome to owners because Jaguar Cars has not officially acknowledged it exists.

Some owners say they have had several prop-shafts replaced under warranty - one American owner says he is on his sixth.

Steven Miller, a 41-year-old attorney from Long Beach, N.Y., suffers from both drivetrain problems. While he says he loves his X-Type, Miller is frustrated by his dealer's inability to repair the problems, despite three visits to the service bay. ""I made a tape recording of the noise,"" Miller said. ""The attempted fix was to put some sort of additive into the all-wheel-drive system. This quieted the noise for several days, then it came back."" ...

This is what turned me away...before this article came out I had heard about this...I hope it doesn't happen to you guys! Thanks for the friendly chat!"
"June 28, 2002 6:04AM",eaweg,"Thanks for the response...I too have read all of the magazines...I love automobile literature! At the same time I have come to realize how much biased opinion there is (and maybe payoffs? )
Anyhow, I would agree with you that so far all of the statistics that have come back point to the Jag leading in numbers...well so does BMW and the G35. I was really interested in the x-type when it came out. It does look quite beautiful. However, I test drove not only one but two. Same opinion. Both felt like fast wheelbarrows. I think you would agree that what it comes down to is personal preferance...I just didn't 'feel' right with the x-type. The BMW I tested I liked quite a bit and it was a tough decision. I have to be honest and say that it was the 'Quattro' that won me over as well as the excellent lease deal. My lease on the Audi was much better than that on the x-type as well. I think that you would also agree that not everyone is going to get a 'perfect car' off the lot (even though we all should). Every car is going to have its minor (and unfortunately some major) problems. Fortunately for me (and hopefully you) I have had none. What concerned me was the article I read from autoweek...

"June 28, 2002 9:41AM",cmnott,"Congrats on your A4!

Look, no question you were quite gracious about my comments about the A4. I was so disappointed with the new styling because I always wanted the previous A4. So to see how it looks, personally, I hate it. maybe it is just me, but I just couldn't come to grips with it.

I found the A4 felt slow reacting whereas the jag had better reflexes. but also felt smaller. i think it is unfair and untrue to say the ""Ford"" thing, I think that has been addressed, whether people choose to beleive it or not. The 6 speed was poor, there is no other word for it, but i really did enjoy the automatic (as far as one can).

the jaguar had a much, much better transmission but I was not particularly enamored with the clutch. the steering, IMO, was better than almost all. I just couldn't justify the price difference when a certain car is TRYING to make an impression in a hot segment.

Like i said before, there are no losers in this segment, but I think it is safe to say none of us would go for the winner of the comparo, eaweg and jagxboytype!"
"June 28, 2002 11:39AM",jagboyxtype,"I totally agree that it is all personal preference, and I really believe that most all of the cars in this segment, especially the A4, S60, and X-TYPE, are some of the best. I don't think there is ""a best"" car here since everyone has different needs and preferences. They all have their own ups and downs, but I think the benefits of each of these cars certainly outweighs most of their negatives as well.

On the X-TYPE article:
I read that Autoweek article too, and it scared me a bit before I went to check out the X-TYPE and made me check the competition before going with the car in the end. Jaguar seems to have solved most all of those problems in the current X-TYPEs though, and the ones being produced now don't have any of those problems. I also found two articles in my local newspaper that were on early X-TYPE problems. The initial article was much like the Autoweek one, and the second one came out a pretty long time after the first one; it was a follow-up on how those initially unhappy customers were doing after Jaguar North America finally contacted them and worked on their cars. They had factory technicians go out and examine the cars and all of that - they even bought back a car and gave the owner a much better new one. Jaguar was a bit late in contacting them (and I agree that it took too long), but they did get most all of their X-TYPEs fixed and the customers ended up being very pleased with their cars in the end.

Yes, some of the very early production X-TYPEs lived up to their old Jaguar reputation for being problematic as the article shows, but the newer ones are much better both in quality and reliability. Jaguar did many things and worked hard to correct the faults of the early cars, and they even had the Whitley Engineering Center, who designed the driveshafts for the X-TYPE, go through five or six different new designs until they finally got it perfect.

I can personally say from experience that the X-TYPE is not in any way a problem car, at least the ones being produced now, especially as my own car has had no problems at all. It initially had the drippy windshield whiper jets, but the dealership simply tightened a valve on the underside of the hood before giving me the car, and nothing has gone wrong since I've had it. I really love even just being around the cars as it has been so good.

Again, it is all personal preference. When I sat in the Jag for the first time, it just felt right. I hadn't even adjusted the seat and it just felt so perfect. Every time I sit in it, everything is perfect. The whole car is that way for me, and I bet your Audi is the same for you.

And if anyone is paying off the media it's BMW and Infiniti, and it appears that Infiniti is paying the most. I don't think Jag even has the funds to do that:-) (Although, global sales were just up 62% in April, and they've had record-setting sales for the past four consecutive years now.)

And, it is very nice to speak to someone civilized on this board. Take care of your car!

Blueguydotcom-

I actually own my car, we paid the dealer in full when we got it. The only incentive for the X-TYPE is a pretty good lease price (I just checked yesterday), but even that has been complained about and called false advertising by many as it is only for the 2.5 litre model with no options (not even paint is included in the advertized price for the lease!). It's also ending in a few months, and then prices will be even higher. I'd like to see how people complain about it being very expensive when the 2003 prices come out, as they are even higher than this year. Oh well, it is a Jaguar after all, and a great car on its own. Option packaging has been reorganized for 2003, however, so getting things like sunroofs is easier."
"June 28, 2002 12:59PM",blueguydotcom,"Is the Jag even selling? I see far more Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes than Jag X-types. And i live in car crazy so-cal."
"June 28, 2002 5:48PM",jagboyxtype,"The X-TYPE is Jaguar's fastest selling car right now, it accounts for over half of all Jaguar's sales, and it has boosted Jaguar's global sales by 62% since January 2002; and that number was recorded from April. In February of 2002, Jaguar's U.S. sales alone were up 105% compared to Feb. 2001, largely because of the X-TYPE. X-TYPE's sales have been taking off after a slower start since the events of 9-11.

Recorded in May, 16,171 X-TYPEs have been sold since January 1, 2002 in the U.S. Of that number, 2,961 were sold in May. Jaguar is very happy with its sales. Also, the X-TYPE is supposed to be lower volume than many of its competators as it is a Jaguar. Never the less, this compares well with 16,395 Audi A4s and 16,339 Volvo S60s sold so far this year. The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far, and 11,237 Cadillac CTS's have been sold in 2002 as well."
"June 30, 2002 7:00PM",eaweg,"Thanks to you both for your great chats...I agree with jagboy that it's nice to see people talk about things without acting like ""my dad can beat up your dad""...my only knowledge from automobiles is that I have a passion for them. Mechanically I am okay...just enough to get by.

It's funny, after I got my Audi the Volvo dealer that's 5 miles form my house had a great deal one week later. Yes I was miffed for about 24 hours but like the both of you I think my personality fits my choice.

You are absolutely right about there not being a loser in this segment. For those who get the G35, more power to you...so you can beat me in a straight line...if racing was what I wanted I would have gotten a used S4 and modded it to about 340hp...but I really couldn't see myself doing that for at least the next 4 years of my life. For some reason I have a sneaking suspicion that something negative is going to come out about the G35...I just can't pinpoint it thought. The '02+ 3 series are just plain ugly with the new facelifts.

Cmnott, as for the 6 speed, yeah it was pretty ""odd"" the first couple of months. I can honestly say though that it has brolen in and that it is worlds better than when I first got it. To think that the 5spd manual in the 96 Saab 900se that I had before it was actually better!!

Oh well, nice chatting again!"
"July 2, 2002 11:42AM",manavi,"To jagboyxtype:

You said, ""The Infiniti G35 has only sold 8,731 units so far.""

I think it's important to point out the G35 has only been on the market since March 11. In the month of April, Infiniti sold over 3200 G35's.

I just want to make sure no one is misled by your post."
"July 2, 2002 12:05PM",jagboyxtype,"My point was that the X-TYPE is selling and that there is a larger amount of them on the road right now than there are G35's or CTS's. Blueguydotcom had asked about its sales numbers and had compared how he had seen few X-TYPEs on the road but many more ""Bimmers, Lexuses, G35s and CTSes"". I just threw in the other cars' numbers to demonstrate that although he may have seen more of some of the other cars, in actuality, there are more X-TYPEs that what he has seen.

Also, Infiniti sold 3,298 G35's in May 2002. Since its introduction in March, it has sold 8,731 units as recorded in May. Assuming that around 3,298 units would have been sold in January and February had the car been introduced earlier and had a start in sales numbers for January 1 like the others, it would have sold about 15,327 units (3,298 + 3,298 + 8,731 = 15327)."
"July 2, 2002 3:46PM",riez,"The latest sales figures are out. The G35 and Lincoln LS both sold about 3,050 units. Cadillac CTS sold 3,475. IS300 only 2,300.

BMW sold 9,630 3 Series."
"July 2, 2002 4:02PM",jagboyxtype,"That total for the 3-Series is for all of its variants though, where many of these manufacturers have other models competing for convertible and coupe etc. sales volumes. The 3-Series sedan, which competes against the cars you mentioned sold 6,498 units, about the same number as the Lexus ES 300, which sold 6,477 units in May."
"July 2, 2002 4:07PM",kahunah,"Apparently in 'Racetrack Fantasy Land', torque steer is a problem for some."
"July 2, 2002 4:32PM",jagboyxtype,"I'm just saying that here in sedan vs. sedan form, that is how many 3's were sold. The other variants are countered with other models in the other marques' lineups.

-The SportCross takes on the 3-Wagons. So do the A4 Avant, V70, C-Class wagons, and the soon to appear X-TYPE Touring.

-The S4 takes on the M3. There is also a C32 AMG. Later, the X-TYPE R will also join that crowd.

-The A4 Cabriolet takes sales from the 3-Convertibles.

-An A4 coupe is on the way, as is the G35 coupe to take one the coupe 3-Series. There are still IS300 coupe rumors, too. To a lesser extent, the C-Class coupe takes on the compact 3-Series in Europe.

And to top that off, the new Saab 9-3 is a sedan now with a normal trunk.

By your thinking: ""You could almost include the Z3 roadster in the mix, as it shares engines, transmissions, and platform parts"", I guess we should include the Camry in the ES300's sales volume since they share those same parts too. How about all of those Jettas, Passats, Beetles, and Golfs that come with that 1.8T engine in the A4? Maybe those should be included too."
"July 26, 2002 6:52PM",richard52,What is your source when you quote sales figures for the cars in this discussion group? No one has mentioned the AcuraTL. I might assume the TL is a sales leader in this class. Am I rite?

"August 5, 2002 7:52PM",xxoneputtxx,"Okay, my head is spinning. I've spent the past month driving several models, reading reviews, hearing opinions, and , truth is, these cars under consideration all look great. Right now, I'm leaning toward BMW 325i, but the G35 impressed me greatly. Also like the Passat wagon (should I bow to the need for storage space) and the idea of saving several $K can't be ignored. Wife has a 2 year old Acura 3.2CL..wonderfully reliable and comfortable, but the BMW, Infiniti, Audi A4, et al have strong pull in the area of ""life is short, go for it"". I guess I 'd say I'm looking for a blend of reliability and driving fun. I'd appreciate input from owners of any of the above, recent years' models. Thanks."

Don't let 'em give you the standard dog and pony test drive. That won't tell you anything. You really need to drive each car some distance on a variety of roads at a variety of speeds.
"August 8, 2002 5:59PM",asz,I am looking at purchasing the G as a family sedan. My 3 kids will easily fit in the rear seat. Is this too much of a sports car? I really like the G's lines. Thanks!
"September 13, 2002 8:21PM",dpvwia2,"I can only speak for the choice between the 325 and the A4. Is you're into the hood badge and sound of the exhaust, then the Beemer is your car. If you want a quite similar ride, the equipment of a 330 at the price of a 325, then go for the A4 3.0.

I drove several '02 325xi's and A4 3.0 Quattro's, and both had their +/-'s. The 325, though, lacks even the most fundamental standard options (no power seats on a $30k+ car!?!?) and has a way to go on the interior design (cheesy exposed cup holders that look like they belong in a Pontiac). Not to mention the 325 has 30% less power to spin those 4 wheels.

The sad thing is that virtually all luxury sports sedan reviews compare a $40k+ loaded 330 with a $33k A4, and the 325 is declared the de facto winner as it rides on the tails of the 330. The whole ""3-series"" nomenclature is nonsense.

Take an A4 3.0 out for a test drive..."
"September 14, 2002 5:42PM",rpawlak98,"I beleive the handling of the BMW is slightly better because of it's small size. I would like to see how it would handle if it were a midsize car (like the Infiniti G35 or Acura TL).

The amount of 'points' that are giving to the BMW for it's handling should be removed for it's size. This is a sedan! It is not a sports car. When talking about sedans, sufficient room in the car should be seen as an important factor.

I'm sure they could make the BMW even smaller and get even better handling and performance from it. If they did that, it would be hard to justify it even being in this category."
"September 14, 2002 8:18PM",kdshapiro,"rp - you are correct the 330i is a sedan, just like the G35, just like the Acura, just like the Audi and all of the cars that were compared in the latest Edmunds round-up. None of them are sports cars. Edmunds calls them Entry Level Luxury Sport Sedans. The fact is the 530i also gets very high marks in the performance department, except the 530i is a true Luxury Sport Sedan, again not a sports car.

Now the 530i outclasses all of the above in terms of amenities, but it would be interesting to see from a strict performance viewpoint, how it compares to the above or even compares to the 330i.

Although in the scheme of things size has little to do with performance - as another poster pointed out there are cars the same size as the 330i that are nowhere near it in terms of overall performance. Note the salient word is overall.

Also the fact that it is a compact has nothing to do with it's interior room. The G does not have marginally much more room and if you read Edmunds round-up, it does state there is sufficient room in the car for 4 adults in the 330i. Unless you regularly transport 5 people and the two people in the back seat absolutely have to have the reclining seats, in my opinion the amount of extra space in the G doesn't make that much of a difference. It might to you, but then you get to vote with your dollars. If I regularly transported 5 people however, none of the cars in the Edmunds round-up would be on my list.

It seems clear to me based on the reviews I've read over the last couple of years, when only talking about the sport of driving in this segment, the 330i is the benchmark."
"September 15, 2002 12:53AM",jagboyxtype,"Some Acuras are experiencing very serious problems with their automatic transmissions shifting from 5th to 2nd at high speeds for no aparent reason. This causes the cars to lose control and swerve off the road.

"September 16, 2002 7:06AM",jpnwdc,"I am having the hardest time choosing a replacement for my 3 year old (leased) Saab 9-3SE. I've narrowed it down to the BMW 325i, Mercedes C240, and VW Passat GLX. They all excel, but in different ways. I've driven all 3 several times and still cannot decide. Here are my thoughts, and I'd appreciate comments from others:

325i pros
fun to drive and handles well
like the sound of the inline 6-cyl. engine
holds its value well
nice safety features
good reliability record

325i cons
many on the road
styling not that exciting any more

Mercedes C240 pros
styling (in my opinion)
solid as a vault
nice ride and handling
safety features

C240 Cons
slightly underpowered
quality concerns (at least from early models)

Passat GLX pros
great looks
cheaper than BMW or Mercedes
decent power and handling
safety

Passat GLX cons
dealer service (from what I've heard)
seats not the best (in my opinion)
soft ride (i.e. not a ""sports sedan"")"
"September 16, 2002 12:29PM",kdshapiro,"Add the following cons to the Mercedes and VW:

- in my area there are many on the road, diminishing the value.

Seriously - I think you have to focus on what's important to you. Is fun to drive, hold's value and good safety features important? Or is styling important and the fact there are many on the road an important criteria because you want a unique vehicle.

Just as a suggestion, if you phrased the question differently rather than giving your opinion about the importantance of certain car attributes you might get some very meaningful responses.

For me important questions might be:

1. Has anybody had any reliability issues with any of these cars? How did the dealers respond?
2. What do others think about the seating in the vehicles?
3. How much did people pay?

Good luck with your decision."
"September 16, 2002 2:18PM",jpnwdc,"kdshapiro - thanks for your post.

I'm finding that it's very hard to judge reliability from the internet message boards. I've read horror stories on the internet for all three cars. People with problems are more likely to post a message than those without problems. Consumer Reports recommends all three cars. I personnally know one person with a C240 and one with a C320 wagon. Both love their cars, but haven't had them too long.

I made a mistake with my current car and am determined not to do it again. I want to get something I don't mind paying for, want to keep for many years, and want to keep shiny. The problem is all three of these are great cars."
"September 16, 2002 2:38PM",techhawk,"These are three pretty different cars, so it really comes down to what you value. The Passat is a real bargain with the nicest and largest interior as well as elegant exterior styling. I looked hard at a GLX and W8 when I was shopping. The handling is pretty wallowing, and the power is just adequate (I'm a leadfoot ).

The 325i is fun and rewarding to drive, really nice handling and ergonomics. Its pretty small and the price goes up fast as you add options, and its also underpowered for my taste.

I've never driven the C240. The C320 I drove was nice, but not terribly sporty and I was disappointed in the quality of some of the interior pieces (they need to see where VW gets their switches).

All three a very good cars, I could be happy with any of them based on my needs."

Do the darker colored TL's look better? Also anyone who owns a TL type S how fast does it go from 0-60? I'm curious because I'm crosshopping with the G35. If the Tl Type S can at least compete with G35's performance that I would be happy
"September 16, 2002 6:55PM",techhawk,"The TL-S does have boring styling and white is its worst color. It fairs better in darker colors. The overall performance is similar to the G35, though it gets edged out in most categories. The biggest difference is FWD vs. RWD. I spent quite a bit of time in a TL-S when shopping recently. I chose a G35, but if you are a Honda fan or prefer FWD the TL-S is a great choice. It will also run you a little less than a comparably equipped G35, and you can probably get a deeper discount to boot. There have been concerns about the TL-S having tranny failures, but Acuras tend to be very reliable.

For direct comparisons of the G35 and TL-S look at the recent Edmunds entry sport lux sedan comparo, the C/D currently on news stands (I have to admit its not very credible to me) and the July 2002 R/T. Good luck with your shopping."

Sedan, coupe, convertible, wagon, and ultra-high performance models. AWD and RWD. Automatic and manual. Choice of engines.

-Out of the group of European sport sedans (e.g. BMW 3, Mercedes-Benz C, Audi A4) the Jaguar X has the most powerful engines.

-The Jaguar Alpine sound system is rated very highly. The auto's section of my newspaper rated the Jaguar Alpine system the top system out of premium European cars in a big comparison test of car stereos. Lexus won the Japanese premium car sound system category with its ML system.

-The car is a wonderful handler; for example, it outperformed the C-320 Sport in that deleted post comparison, and although it does not have the class-leading acceleration times, it is only about 0.2 second behind the 3-Series and is in the top end of its class when it comes to performance (0-60 in 6.3 seconds - Car&Driver; 0-60 in 6.5 seconds - Road&Track). With its AWD, it can corner like no other car.

-Braking performance from 60mph is just two feet longer than the Porsche 911 GT2 (116 feet), at 118 feet. Thus, it stops in the same distance as a smaller BMW M-Roadster (118 ft.). Brakes are from the larger S-TYPE.

-Connoly leather and wood are all standard in the Jag, and leather and wood are only optional (if available) in competor's models.

-It has the most rigid structure in its class, over 30% higher than the previous class leader.

-Synthetic interior materials (e.g. plastics and not-leather soft-touch areas) are made by the same company from the same materials from the same machines that manufacture synthetic materials for Audi's A6 and new A8, which are ""industry leading"" according to many.

-The X-TYPE does weigh a little more than a RWD car as it carries an extra differential and drive shaft for its AWD, but that doesn't seem to hurt its performance. It actually helps it in many ways. Also, for instance, it weighs less than an Audi A4, Cadillac CTS, and Lincoln LS.

-There is some engine noise entering the cabin, but even wispers are still audible from passengers. Plus, it's a sports-sedan, so the engine is supposed to have a nice little note to it. Many reviewers have enjoyed the sound the X-TYPE's engine makes. There is also almost no wind noise as exterior mirrors, etc. were sculpted from windtunnel tests at Pininfarina and high-speed tests on the Nardo bowl in Italy as well as the Nurburgring in Germany.

-Clutch: yes, some people dislike its feel, yet others like it because it is not difficult to use. I believe that it was MotorWeek that stated it felt like a BMW clutch.

-Pricing: you can get a base X-TYPE for around $29,000 - $30,000 with leather and wood, manual transmission, metallic paint, etc. Option packages have been re-organized to allow more individual options to be ordered. Competators like the MB C-Class sedan start at around $31,000 without leather and wood, but vinyl and plastic.

About the only virtue the X-TYPE doesn't have are memory seats. Beyond those, it's one hellofa car. I doubt it would still be making up 56.7% of Jaguar's sales and dominating an unheard-of 66% of its market in Europe (especially Italy) if it weren't a great car.

On the Acura transmission problems, only 16,000 cars have been afficted with the problem over the past two years, according to the posted article. Accura sells a lot of cars, so it does not seem to be a massive or wide-spread problem. Hopefully they'll fix it, but I wouldn't worry about it too much."
"September 21, 2002 7:57PM",riez,jagboyxtype... Have you been reading what European Car has been writing? I'd encourage you to read their articles. They have a web site. I didn't write them. Please don't shoot me. I just passed along what an interesting source said. I happen to agree with many of their comments. Not all. And I hope Jaguar works aggressively to improve the X-type.
"September 21, 2002 8:47PM",jagboyxtype,"""Please don't shoot me.""

I wasn't trying to shoot you. You are just being paranoid. I never even mentioned you in my whole response except for in the title where I was directing my message to what had been said that you passed along. I said ""they"" as in the editors of European Car, but if you are now using the ""royal we"" and took what I said as directed towards you, now you know that is not how it was meant. I will shoot some words at you about improving the X-TYPE, however, as I don't feel the car needs any improving at all except in a very few minor areas, such as memory seats (not that they are really needed, but it would be a nice touch). Everything that makes a Jag is there in the X-TYPE, and it is a great car on its own. Naturally, Jaguar will improve the X-TYPE just as it improves all of its cars. As for your fear of being shot at with words on this board, perhaps you shouldn't say things that would cause you to get shot at if that is a fear of yours.

BTW, every month, over 3,000 people just in the U.S. disagree with you and with European Car about the X-TYPE. Sorry buddy, but you're in the minority on this one. However, European Car's own final words on their X-TYPE test were:

""Pushed to the limit and the X-Type will gently push until you ease off the throttle. Muscled around the track however, and its possible to slide the sedan until the tires melt. Great fun!

I came away from the X-Type totally surprised. I expected to find a meek and mild sedan but instead found a serious contender in the sport-sedan market. These first two offerings are great!...I can't wait to see what those rouges at Jag's R division have in store for the X-Type."""
"September 22, 2002 2:10AM",affy,"Why isn't Audi considering shipping the A3, S3 here, i belive there's a lot of market potential here in our shore. It make perfect sense to have a A3 to battle against the Benz C-230 coupe and the BMW 320i. I saw picture of the A3 and it look ok, right now i'm considering to purchase an A4 3.0, i want to comapre the A4 3.0 and the S3. Audi should ship the lux-golf here!"
"September 22, 2002 6:08AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Ya gotta stay calm. Did you notice in your most recent post you did write ""over 3,000 people just in the US disagree with YOU and with European Car about the X-type.""

Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written? The X-type has gotten mixed reviews at best in America. Don't believe it has ""won"" a single comparison test. See R&T's recent 11-car sport sedan comparison. Think that says a ton when X-type falls short badly in comparison tests.

Can you steer me to an American comparison test in which the X-type won?

And what do sales have to do with how truly good a sport sedan is? I see a lot of people driving Malibu, Taurus, I30, ES300, etc. To many (most!) people a car is either an appliance or a status symbol. But it is only the rare few who are truly interested in all around performance. Some people might argue that low sales are a better indicator. Most people want cushy ride on interstate, not 0-60 times or slalom results. The IS300 crowd might wear their low sales as a badge of honor."
"September 22, 2002 6:26AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Do you read MT or R&T?

Check out the November 2001 issue of Motor Trend. MT pans the X-type 3.0 AUTOMATIC in their 5-car comparison. In 10 areas of their ""Report Card"", the Jag wins just one, styling. Has last place or 2nd to last place rating in powertrain, ride, interior design, seat comfort/support, rear-cabin space, trunk useability, and value. Track results mediocre. Fourth place 0-60 mph time. 2nd slowest slalom time. Worst braking result. They tested a moderately loaded $43,695 one.

Check out the July 2002 issue of Road & Track. R&T pans the X-type 3.0 MANUAL in their 11-car comparison. X-type comes in 10th overall, 9th in just subjective ratings, and 10th in just performance ratings. They tested a loaded $46,510 one.

Does that mean you disagree with me, European Car, R&T, and MT? Wonder if you and the other 3,000 people are reading what is out there? And test driving the X-type against its competitors?"
"September 22, 2002 8:10AM",merc1,"Isn't that comparo a little bit much? I mean how does a ""almost a 1/2 second"" = ""throat raming"" or ""pummelling"" ? I would expect the Jaguar to be faster with a stick and the Benz with an auto. I have nothing against the X-Type, but that test is a little thick in my opinion.

One other thing: Who says the X-Type has the most rigid structure in this class? I've read that the C320 Sport, 330i and especially the A4 all have very stout structures. This has also been my experience in driving all three of them.

M"
"September 22, 2002 2:29PM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Check out the February 2002 issue of Car and Driver. 7 car comparison. X-type 3.0 MANUAL came in 5th place. Woes included lack of overall performance, poor ride quality, poor brakes, and poor skidpad. X-type was tied for 2nd slowest 0-60 mph time (7.2 seconds), longest braking distance, 2nd worst skidpad result, but did have the 2nd best emergency-lane-change maneuver mph. C&D's X-type was pretty basic, with only a $39,170 MSRP.

Notice the trend, all the tested X-type's had stickers of $39,000 and up, and most publications harp that the Jag fails to deliver the goods for so many dollars.

Pushing $40,000 does NOT seem to be entry-level to me. The X-type 2.5 is more the entry-level Jaguar."
"September 22, 2002 6:56PM",dpvwia2,How about the fact that it look like a Ford Contour? Yikes...
"September 23, 2002 3:52AM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-

The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series. You may check out AutoWeek's review of the car for that information, as well as a review on the site autobytel.com and reviews conducted by Autocar including their ""Autocar Book"" all about the X-TYPE. I never said that any of those cars you mentioned didn't have very solid and rigid structures nor did I try to imply that, but at the moment, the Jaguar has the most rigid structure in its class.

Also, as riez would say, ""I did not write the article"". The reviewers were the ones who said all of those quotes about the X-TYPE beating the C-Class in every part of that test, and not just acceleration times. Take braking (""top drawer"" for the X-TYPE), or how they said the cars felt when being driven.
____________________________________

Riez-

I pity you, because you only believe what car magazines tell you, and you allow them to choose for you what is best instead of collecting your own information and actually checking things out for yourself. Listen to what you've been sayin: ""Car & Driver said this, and MotorTrend said this, and Road & Track said this"". Granted, I have used their quotes and stats many times to back my own opinions as well (which I even do here), but you've taken it to an extreme.

""Do you read MT or R&T?"" you ask me.
Sometimes I do, but only for entertainment purposes. Why? Because I do not trust them, do not believe everything they say, and only take what they have to say as their own human opinions. And I am not the only one who feels that way. ABC News, for instance, did an investigation on the subject of car magazines being biased and omitting facts to suit their own interests. They use the Ford Focus and Car&Driver and MotorTrend's opinions of the car as an example:

""For example, in January, Car and Driver listed the Ford Focus among its '10 Best Cars of the Year.' It never mentioned that Ford had recalled the Focus eight times for various problems when that review was written [one such recall was because the wheels would fall off of the car!]. Also, just this month, when Motor Trend's review came out — no mention of the recalls or the fact that the government has five ongoing safety-related investigations of the Focus. (It currently has six ongoing investigations, but only five that Motor Trend could have known of when it went to press.)""
http://www.abcnews.com

Hmmm. Six government safety investigations, eight major recalls in its few years of production, and the Focus is a favorite among car magazines like Car&Driver and MotorTrend. Well, they can have it, and I'm sure you think it's a wonderful little car since everything they say suddenly becomes law for you.

ABC also mentions how certain car manufacturers that give all-expense paid trips to reviewers get higher scores and better reviews when the reviewers handle their cars. Even an auto reviewer interviewed in the article said ""there are other subtle ways that automakers try to woo the press"". MotorTrend's own C. Van Tune admitted to utilizing these perks from certain auto makers although his magazine has the resources to pay for these trips, etc. on its own.

The warning at the end of the article reads: ""So far, the big magazines don't seem to have changed their policies. So, be aware: When you read and see reviews of this year's models, some of those reviews were written by reporters who've been fed and fueled by the car companies.""

It can be expected that comparison tests would be especially succeptible to the effects of biases and perks from some automakers. This is why you cannot believe and trust car magazines for anything more than entertainment and a very few facts.

""Have you even taken the time to read what European Car has written? Or what MT and C&D have previously written?"" you also ask me. Yes, I have. European Car's own review of the X-TYPE is nothing short of pure flattery towards the car. Road&Track's review of the X-TYPE is also very complementary. Car&Driver tested the X-TYPE's 0 - 60 time as just 6.3 seconds and raved about ""enthusiast goods"" of the car. MotorTrend enjoyed the car very much, and bought their own long-term tester, of which they say ""This new X is one shaggy Jaggy"" and ""I'm anxious to try out the upcoming R version of the X-TYPE, because this is a very good sport sedan"". AutoWeek liked the car and decided that ""X"" was definitely an addition to the ""A"", ""C"", and ""3"" in the sport sedan equation. Forbes wrote a very fine review of the car. A vast majority of other reviews, such as those at carpoint and autobytel are also complementary to the X-TYPE. And again, Autocar was so inspired that they created a minibook about the ""Most Important Jaguar Ever"" and said that between it and a 330i, they don't know which one they would choose - ""it's that close"".

You mention ""American"" tests in your posts. I must also ask you, however, why you believe that any reviews or comparison tests about the X-TYPE from any other parts of the world are suddenly invalid? They are all reviews, how come only the ones you choose count? There are people from all over the world here at Edmunds, are their views and opinions also invalid to you because they do not live in the same country as you do?

On the matter of that Road&Track 11 car comparison, the reviewers say:
""So how, you ask, did a car as nice as the Jaguar X-TYPE end up second to last in this great big comparison test? That's easy: Price.""
Notice that they happened to also have loaded their X-TYPE with every option available on the car including such expensive items as the navigation system, weather package, and premium sound system, etc. Yet, other cars in their test were not fully loaded as the Jaguar was. The BMW, for instance, was lacking its navigation system and other items, the Mercedes-Benz (the second most expensive car in the group at $44,949) also without its navigation system and lacking its premium sound system (and in fact left without a CD player that no one seems to complain about not having in this car for this price, where as the Jaguar can take heat for having just a single-disc indash unit when not equipped with the 6-disc changer). A test with price included is not valid unless all cars are optioned out with the same equipment. The X-TYPE had much more than any of the other cars in the test did. A better comparison for price would have been to compare base prices of the cars or prices of options, or get this: equip the cars similarly. Take note that both the Saab and the Mercedes-Benz have higher starting prices than the Jaguar, and that the Jag's starting price is about $1,500-$2,000 above most of the other cars in the test, and that it comes standard with wood and leather which costs about $1,500-$2,000 to equip on the other cars. AWD is also standard on the Jag, and extra-cost options on the cars that can have it equipped. La"
"September 23, 2002 3:54AM",jagboyxtype,"<continued>Later in that same R&T issue, they happen to have purchased, out of all those cars, a long-term X-TYPE.

Also, on price, let's not complain about the X-TYPE when Road&Track's $39,804 (and I count that as near $40,000, wouldn't you?) BMW 330i does not even come with power seats in another comparo (page 74 of their ""Road Test Annual 2002"").


So what else did R&T say about the X-TYPE in that 11 car test? How about ""Whether the chassis is redolent of Jaguar tradition or not, no one complained that it didn't work. It feels like a modern, well-balanced sports sedan with excellent highway ride and good balance in the corners. Every time we got into a long stretch of fast, curving mountain road, whoever was in the Jag inevitably got on the walkie-talkies we all carry and said, 'This thing is really good in the curves.' It's a confidence-inspiring car, with good grip, linear steering, and precise turn-in. The engine is not bad either...our test car's optional 3.0-litre 4-cam V-6 put out a respectable 231 bhp, keeping it in this fast company with no particular effort...Overall, the X-TYPE is a comfortable, pleasent and useful car with a well-developed chassis...It's a good all-rounder with, probably just as much British charm as most modern drivers really want. Independent of price, it scored in about the middle of our group in performance and subjective ratings."" As a side note, they also say, ""The Jag's interior is a rich assemblage of shapes and textures, done up with nice details like the silver-rimmed green-faced gauges. Given its soft ride, the X-TYPE delivered surprisingly good handling"". http://www.roadandtrack.com


And most of its other reviews have said pretty much the same things about the car as stated above: good handling, nice styling, comfortable interior. Yeah, there are some bad reviews, but there are many many more good ones, and it doesnt't get ""panned"" as you have continually been repeating.


Let's also not overlook the TOP GEAR 2002 Motoring Survey, in which ""over 37,000 motorists"" were spoken to about 120 car models and 33 manufacturers. The rankings for the entry-level cars were:

1.) Lexus IS 200

2.) Jaguar X-TYPE

3.) BMW 3-Series

4.) Mercedes-Benz C-Class

5.) Audi A4 and A4 Avant (wagon)

6.) Saab 9-3

7.) Volvo S40 and V40 (wagon)

8.) Alfa Romeo 156


They had little quotes by some of the cars. The X-TYPE's read: ""Just past its first anniversary and the X-Type enters the survey three places ahead of the BMW 3-Series [out of the total 120 cars]. Great dealer service, few problems and good dynamics see to that.""


Let's not argue here though riez. We both have opinions, and I simply don't agree with yours. Hostilities aside, have a great day! :-)

The whole Jaguar/Ford thing died a long time ago. X-TYPE shares 6 points on its platform with the Mondeo - not even its entire platform, and it shares no body panels with any other car. Anyone could just as easily say that your A4 is just a Jetta with four rings on its grille.

"September 23, 2002 4:03AM",kdshapiro,"The X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader, the BMW 3-Series.

I think the Xtype still has a way to go as far as I go, before I ever would consider one to be a class leader.

While you have a private debate going with riez - my two cents you buy what you buy for the reasons you buy, but the trades and mags of barometers. You have to read them, understand where they intersect with your beliefs and opinions and take it from there.

In addition, a $40K 330i is almost loaded and a base 330i can be had for $32K at ED plus air-fare."
"September 23, 2002 4:55AM",jagboyxtype,"Here, I built a fully-loaded RWD 330i:

MSRP fully loaded: $45,235

This was done at the BMW U.S. website. It's a little higher than that $40K estimate of yours. My point is not to single out the 3 for high pricing, but to demonstrate that while a nicely equipped one can be had for around $40,000, like any other car in its class, it carries a high price when totally fully loaded. This is my point about the X-TYPE in the 11 car R&T comparison: a nicely equipped one (similarly equipped with that $40,000 3 in the test) can be had for around $40,000, but the editors instead chose to get a totally fully loaded one and then mark it down for a high price. It wasn't quite fair. Totally fully loaded, the Mercedes-Benz would have been the most expensive car in the test by quite a margin. Ever notice how the E-Class starts at around $50,000, but the S-TYPE and 5-Series start at around $42,000?

As far as class leaders go, I believe that all of the cars in this class are very good, and that they target slightly different groups. X-TYPE and C-Class have more luxury than the others, G35 and 3-Series are a little more performance oriented, but all of them share many traits with slight variances in the degrees of those traits.

It's nice to hear from you! We haven't talked for a while. Happy driving!"
"September 23, 2002 6:40AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... I merely pointed out how when the American automotive press has had a chance to test the X-type up against its main competitors, it falls flat. Pretty much every single American comparison test.

Why do I bring up American tests? Because I cannot buy a Euro-spec X-type in America. And many of the European cars a Euro-spec X-type is compared against in these tests aren't even sold in America. Besides marques like Fiat, SEAT, Alfa, Lancia, etc. Heck I can't even spell the French marques that are no longer sold in USA: Renault and Peugueot. Been so long since since I've even seen an old French-marque car in my neighborhood.

So ensuring all the cars are USA-spec is critical to a legitimate comparison.

And I've always loved the pro-Brit bias in the English car magazines. They do whatever they can to say nice things about English cars. I leaf thru their mags at my local Borders and Barnes & Noble. The German press has raved about the underlying Ford Mondeo platform. Mondeo built in Germany."

As far as that test goes, I think it was basically set up to show up any weakness the C320 may have.I don't think a 1/2 second is stomping anything into the ground, and the Jag should have been faster considering it was a manual. Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily. I'd be more impressed with a ""pumeling"" by the X-Type of the 330i or IS300 in those areas.

Don't get me wrong, I don't think the X-Type is a bad car, but that test had more than a twinge of bs to it.

I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.

People have different requirments for what they want in a car. We have to be careful between comparing the MSRP of fully optioned cars, because most people do not order them that way. The base 330i with leatherette can be had at ED for a mere $32,000.

They say, ""This particular parts-sharing, it turns out, only gives the Jag its chassis 'hard points' and its engine blocks, but not much else. Jaguarites say the chassis itself shares only six small panels with its blue-oval counterpart, and that their version has been reinforced significantly for stiffness and quiet. In fact, they boast, by the time the leaper hood ornament goes on the car, its static rigidity is 30 percent better than that of the nearest luxury segment competitor. By another measure, body stiffness comes in at 22 kg/degree vs. the 21 kg/degree recorded by the BMW 3 Series, a mighty fine measuring stick to use."" <--See, they measured it.</b>

Other reviews have noted that it has the most rigid structure in its class, I can find them and post their URLs if you'd like, if this review is not proof enough.

Also, if the link doesn't work because the site is a sign-in type, go to autoweek.com and use their search box, typing in ""Jaguar X-type"".

BTW: I do think that X-TYPE v. C-Class review was also a little ""BS""-ed, however, I believe all comparison reviews are either a little biased or include some BS, as you can read about in my long posts a few messages away. However...

You say ""Beating the C-Class at acceleration and braking is not really that hard since that isn't what the car focuses on primarily.""

Isn't the C-Class supposed to compete with the IS300, 330i, and X-TYPE? Why is it that when the X-TYPE does win, excuses can be made for the other car(s), with ""they don't focus on those areas""? I'm willing to invalidate the transmissions in the this test as they were not totally evenly matched there, but the X-TYPE won out every other category of the test as well: Engine, brakes, ride... I could just as easily say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on those areas either, but no one would back me and it really is a poor excuse. You also note that 1/2 second is not ""stomping anything to the ground"", yet in the Road&Track 11-car test, the X-TYPE was just 0.6 second slower than the fastest car in the test, and it was marked down for that. We can't suddenly make an exception for this test. I could say that the X-TYPE doesn't focus on acceleration in the R&T review, but again that is a poor excuse. If we choose to accept the R&T 11 car test, then we must, by principle, accept this test as well. In those regards, the X-TYPE v. C-Class comparison was quite valid.

Take care!
__________________________________

Riez-

I think I'll terminate this discourse now that we have both had our say. It's just going to continue in a perpetual loop if we don't stop. But...

I noticed that you still say the car falls flat, and in all of those comparisons, you have said yourself that price was a major factor in the car's losing points, as well as R&T, C&D, and others noting that. I'm just wondering if you read my really long message a ways back, as I outlined how the X-TYPE in all of those tests was outfitted much more heavily with options than any of the other cars and that its price would have been closer to the others had the X-TYPE been outfitted with the same options as the others in the test. Also, as merc1 notes, 1/2 second differences, etc. are not large gaps. Being 0.6 second off from the fastest car in the test, and 0.5 from the winning car is not ""falling flat"" by any means.

You seem to fail to notice actual measurements and what the reviewers write about the cars, and instead only look at points and scores. Take note of the ""luggage space"" scores for the cars in the R&T 11 car test, for instance. The X-TYPE has a boot capacity of 16.0 cubic feet. For that, it received 7.8 out of 10 possible points in that category. Now look at the Cadillac CTS with a boot capacity of 12.8 cubic feet. Yet it received 8.4 points out of the 10, and it had a smaller boot. The Infiniti G35 has 14.8 cubic feet of boot space, yet even with less space than the X-TYPE, it received the same score of 7.8 out of 10. The 330i, with only 10.7 cubic feet of boot space received 7.6 points, only 0.2 less point than the X-TYPE with 5.3 more cubic feet than the 330i. These ratios aren't right, and I cannot help but feel that their other points and scores must also be affected by these kinds of discrepancies.

I also still disagree with you about European or other comparison tests not being valid. Included in these tests are cars such as the X-TYPE, C-Class, and A4, et al, that are sold in the U.S., as well as cars that are not available here. Just because a car is not U.S.-spec doesn't mean the test is totally invalid. In those other countries especially, those tests are very valid (as far as comparison tests go). It is not a question of whether or not the test is valid just to you, rather, it is a matter of how valid the test is as a fair test. That's where the problem is, you are choosing which tests you want to acknowledge and which you simply feel like leaving out. Besides, the difference between a U.S.-spec car and a non-U.S.-spec car is not going to come out in the test unless the car is crash tested or has an engine choice unavailable in the U.S., etc. You can get a general idea still, and to simply say that because it is not a test conducted by an American magazine is a bit ignorant. Especially as all of these cars are global cars.

You also claim that English reviews have a bias towards British cars and that the Germans also are biased. However, I have found that those two groups especially are very picky about cars and will tear a car apart worse than any American reviewer would dare to. The British also have a thing for BMW's - a German car - and I've not found a review where they had a bias for Jaguar or any other British car, and if they were biased and I missed it, they certainly could not be any more biased than any American editors.

Perhaps you have not noticed the bias that American reviewers have for German and Japanese cars? I believe Edmunds stated something about their ""infatuation"" with ""everything German"" in a Mercedes review, and the idea that Japanese cars are so much more reliable than any other cars is also overplayed to the point of now being a bias of American writers (and don't attempt to say that I'm saying that Japanese cars are not reliable now, because they are, I'm simply pointing out that there is an American bias of believing that they are tremendously more reliable than any other kind of car)."

You said ""I don't know what car you speced out but it's not my car. I don't deem a Nav system a must on a fully loaded car. I am talking about leather, sport and most high end options. My 330i does not have sport, nav or xenon, but if I did it again, I might have gotten sport. To me it's fully loaded because there is nothing else I wanted and I belive the Navs are the biggest waste of money anyway. If you want to split hairs and say fully loaded is every available option, that's your call.""

That's exactly what I was trying to prove about the X-TYPE in its tests. Take, for instance, the Road&Track 11 car comparo. The X-TYPE had every option available including the unnecessary navigation system and other equipment that the majority of other cars did not have. It has been that way in almost every comparison test: the editors choose a fully loaded (as in every single available option) X-TYPE and then mark the car down for being expensive in comparison to competitors that are not fully loaded.

You are totally correct, NO ONE ever totally and fully loads out their car with every available option, but the reviewers all do for the X-TYPE in its comparison tests. They don't for the other cars. Even that second-most-expensive-car in the test C320 Sport was still not fully loaded, it didn't even have a CD player, as I mentioned before in my other message. In the magazines, they depict the X-TYPE as costing $46,000 all of the time. A base X-TYPE 2.5 with standard Connoly leather, wood trim, and manual transmission can be had at $29,000. Make the car a 3.0 litre model, and you get everything in the base model plus standard indash CD player and other goodies, and your choice of manual or automatic transmission at no extra cost, for $35,000. Nicely equipped, a 2.5 is usually around $33,000. A nicely equipped 3.0 is around $38,000.

In my other message, I wasn't trying to talk about your car. I was using the 3-Series as an example of how in the tests they'll get a nicely equipped one at $39,000 - $40,000, but that the car's fully loaded price is $45,000, just as they only showed the X-TYPE's fully loaded price of about $46,000, when one that is nicely equipped is between $38,000 - $40,000 just like the other cars."
"September 24, 2002 10:28AM",kdshapiro,Okay I missed the point that particular car left nothing out in the options category. Most people do not buy a car like that.
"September 24, 2002 12:35PM",riez,"jagboyxtype... Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type. )

And I'll really, really start worrying about and paying attention to European magazine results when Euro-spec cars are sold here. But today I can NOT even buy them. Think you should keep in mind that they often have many differences with their American counterparts (e.g., safety equipment, engines--they love diesels, transmissions) and there are tons of marques in Europe that are absent in America (Alfa, Fiat, Lancia, SEAT, Renault, Peugeout, Skoda, etc.)"
"September 24, 2002 5:58PM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-

You missed the target again. The trunk space example was simply an example of how the points awarded to certain aspects of the cars in the tests do not tell the whole truth, as you misguidedly seem to believe. The fact of the matter is that the X-TYPE had more boot space than the other cars I mentioned, and it recieved less points than they did and in an unbalanced ratio, and that other scoring categories were similarly affected. You also failed to notice the phrases ""For example"" and ""For instance"" leading into what I was saying in many cases if you believe that boot space was all that I was speaking about.

You said of the X-TYPE's large boot ""And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit useability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multi-link hinges.""

From this I can tell that you never actually take the time to examine a car for yourself before passing judgement on it, but instead rely completely upon little comparison test articles and your own assumptions, as the X-TYPE does have multi-link boot hinges as opposed to the swan-neck hinges on such cars as the XJ8 and ES300, ect. that you assumed it had, and then stated it had as if it were a fact. But what can I expect from someone who finds himself clever at falsely mistaking a car for one with which it shares a few parts that cannot even be seen?

And on that topic, in the global car world of today, every car shares parts with another or many others. *FOR EXAMPLE* (<--if you miss it this time, I don't know what to do), BMW uses General Motors-sourced automatic transmissions and parts are shared with Mini. Volkswagen and Audi, Seat, Skoda, Porsche, Bentley, Lamborghini, and Bugatti all share many <i>many parts. DaimlerChrysler and Mercedes-Benz share some parts now too, as well as sharing parts with Hyundai and Mitsubishi. Making fun of that seems, well, kind of pathetic - unless you have a weird sense of humor. They share parts; yeah - so what? It's not really relevant.

And as I noted about reviews and comparisons from other countries, the cars do have some differences from U.S.-spec cars (as you and I had noted that engines can be different, etc.) but a general idea of the car can be had from those tests - as I had also said before in my other message. Quite often, those tests even use the versions of the cars equipped with engines that are sold with them in the U.S., as we generally have the larger versions of the engines available to us. If it's a diesel-engine test, they usually also have the whole test based upon that fact and will call it a ""Diesel Showdown!"" or something else to that same effect. Again (for now the second time), you cannot simply invalidate a test because it was not conducted in America. The cars we are disputing are not even built in America. And many times, the versions of the cars used in the tests are for the most part equivalent to their U.S.-spec versions. Alpha Romeos, Fiats, Renaults, and Vauxhalls are not sold in America, and thus I understand saying that for use in America, their tests would be for the most part inconcequential; but Audis, Jaguars, BMWs, and Mercedes are all sold in the U.S. as well as foreign countries, and those foreign versions of the cars have little difference from their U.S.-spec versions as far as any test categories can gauge. They never crash-test the cars in these comparisons, and as C. Van Tune pointed out in the ABC article about how reviewers are ""fed and fueled"" by certain car manufacturers, safety isn't an exciting enough category for these tests, so to those reviewers who write about them, it is irrelevant. Safety equipment is usually the primary difference between U.S.-spec and foreign versions of the same cars, but that's not going to show-up in one of these car comparisons because they are not comprehensive enough at all to measure such things. Yet it's not just foreign articles that you are saying are invalid, though. You are just choosing the ones that back your arguement to the slightest degree, which again just a display of your ignorance.

As well as the boot-hinge thing that you got wrong (remember, X-TYPE has the multi-link hinges with auto-opening gas struts, not swan-neck hinges), you also said that it had a cramped rear seat in comparison to its competators. In comparison to a long-wheelbase Maybach, it is cramped, yes. However, it has one of the larger rear seats in its class. Not only is it larger than the BMW 3-Series' rear seat as well as the IS300's and A4's, but it is also larger than the midsize 5-Series' rear seat (but I'll admit not by that much compared to the 5). In posts in other sections of the Town Hall, you defend how large the 5-Series' rear seat is and how comfortable it is for adult passengers as far as roominess goes, why do you call the X-TYPE's rear seat - which is even larger than the 5's - ""cramped"". Is this yet ANOTHER ASSUMPTION that you made about the X-TYPE?

By now I am sure that you have noticed that I have continually refered to things in this message that I have already spoken about in my other two posts addressed to you a few messages back. I'm wondering if you really even read them since your arguements are always the same, and now you're even making outright assumptions. No matter what I say and no matter how many facts I back my statements with, you seem to have your eyes closed to them and don't even take them into account. Not only that, but your statements are generally incorrect and your assumptions don't even touch on facts or reality.

And I'd say the best selling Jaguar in history is competative when it makes up 56.7% of Jaguar's U.S. sales and holds an astonishing 66% of the entry-level to mid luxury segment in Europe, as well as over 70% of Jaguar's sales in its third largest market, Italy. Was your statement about being competative just another assumption on your part?

Maybe we'll actually have a discussion when you start taking note of what's actually going on with the car and stop making assumptions and false remarks. Good day."
"September 24, 2002 11:27PM",merc1,"Ok, I read all that. So I'm supposed to believe Jaguar's claim over what every other brand claims right? Until I see an independent test of all of the cars in this class structural rigidity, I'll go by what feels the most solid, and it isn't the Jaguar X-Type. So we disagree there.
Secondly, everyone knows full well that the C-Class is not on the same plane with the 330i and IS300 when it comes to being ""sporty"". To impress me you'd have to beat those cars at all the track tests. Beating a C320 at the track isn't hard, the IS300 and 330i rule there. That acceleration test will never count in my book because of the trans difference.

I'm not saying the comparison as a whole was not valid, but I still maintain that they picked the areas in which the X-Type would winout. And Lastly the X-Type has been ranked below the C in every OTHER comparo done. If it were such a slaughter I'd think it would win some test over here too.

"September 25, 2002 5:40AM",riez,"jagboyxtype... You should have more carefully read my post. Did I specifically mention the X-type trunk (boot)? No, I was discussing trunks in general. And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans? Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors? When you get creamed on the track and street, talk about the trunk?

I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove? If we used that we'd all be driving a Camry or Accord 4-cyl sedan!

As for Euro-land market, keep in mind two huge facts. Currently about 40 percent of the cars sold there are diesels. The ""hottest"" BMW is the 330id. Can I buy that in USA? NO! And that over 80 percent of the cars sold there are manual transmission. How many manual transmission diesel sedans, coupes, convertibles, etc. are sold in USA? Be willing to bet the figure is about zero. Ford Europe and Jag are rushing to get diesels into their Euro-products."
"September 25, 2002 7:24PM",jagboyxtype,"Riez-

Again my point was that the boot space example was an example of how the points awarded in such comparison tests do not give real data. Points and scores are skewed - or whatever adjective you would use to describe awarding more space with less points in a category that is all about having more space.

""And did you notice how I was careful to say that neither trunk space nor rear-seat space should have much, if any bearing, when it comes to comparing serious all around sport sedans?""

Yes, I did catch that phrase the first time I read it. However, your argument against the X-TYPE in you message before the last was that it had a cramped rear seat and had swan-neck boot-lid hinges - both statements that were false. And now your latest statement that you did not name the X-TYPE directly when speaking of such things as boot-space and rear-seat room really is a weak cover-up.

You stated: ""Maybe we'll have something to discourse about when Ford improves the future Mondeo X-type such that it can actually be competitive against cars in its class. As it stands, it just doesn't compete well as a serious all around sport sedan. Sure it has a big trunk, but it also has a cramped back seat. But I don't buy a serious all around sport sedan based on interior or trunk space. And sometimes a big trunk is offset by an odd shape and space-intruding hinges that limit usability over a smaller trunk that is nicely shaped with multilink hinges. (Oops, think I meant to say when Jag improves the future X-type.""

Your argument was that you do not consider rear-seat room or trunk space when it comes to sport-sedans because those are two areas in which the X-TYPE excels. If it had a small boot and a cramped back seat, then you would be attacking the car for those two points! Then, to further attempt to deride the X-TYPE, you state that large boots, such as the X-TYPE has, often have space-intruding swan-neck hinges and odd opening shapes. Of course you did not have to ""name"" the X-TYPE when making such statements - you implied it and did indeed name the car with the word, ""it"". Why even mention space-intruding hinges if the X-TYPE does not have them? Also, paragraphically, your topic was about the X-TYPE, and as those areas were spoken about there, they are directly linked to the X-TYPE. However, your arguments were wrong, and to counter my catching of them being wrong, you are now stating that you were not speaking of the X-TYPE - a weak argument.

""I don't care about sales figures. What do they prove?""

You constantly say that the X-TYPE does not compete well against its competators. Sales figures and how much of the car's manufacturer's sales the car makes are a direct indication of how well the car competes. If the car did not compete well, then it would in turn have low sales figures and most probably not make up much of its manufacturer's sales. The Camry and Accord 4-cylinder are not in the entry-level sport sedan class. However, in their own class, it is generally accepted that they are very good cars. Also, the ratio of new buyers of a new addition to an established market segment is an indication of how well the car competes, and over 90% of X-TYPE buyers are new customers to Jaguar. That means that it is taking sales from competators that compete in that market segment - thus it is competing very well.

If you have not gotten the fact that there are European comparison tests of cars that are sold here in slightly different forms but with the same engines as U.S.-spec versions, then it is just a show of your unwillingness to be reasonable to any degree. I have stated that those cars are not exact doubles of their U.S. versions, but the ones outfitted with gasoline engines that are available in the U.S. and other such options are so much like their American versions that a comparison test is not going to be able to differentiate the two. If there are differences measurable by the tests, then you can take them into account. However, to invalidate the entire test is ignorant and unreasonable.

""Do you harp on such little things regarding the X-type becasue it does so poorly in the performance realm when tested against its competitors?""

No, I ""harp"" on such little things because YOU bring them up by making FALSE assumptions which you present as if they were facts. Again, I used those ""little"" subjects as examples to prove my points because facts are a necessity in presenting the truth. YOU are the one who decided to ""harp"" on my examples.

Also, as I have stated and continue to have to remind you, the X-TYPE does not get beaten in the performance realm against competators. EXAMPLES: the X-TYPE completely won an all-out performance test against the competing model from Mercedes-Benz, the C320 Sport. It is a competing car. Then, your so-very-important Road&Track even states: ""In acceleration, the 3.0 X-TYPE is among the quickest. Accompanied by a nice-but-distance exhaust note, the Jag goes from 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds, undercutting the boy-racer Lexus IS 300's and Audi A4's 7.1, Mercedes-Benz C320's 6.8 sec. and matching the BWM 330i's time. And remember the X-TYPE, like the Quattro, loses a tick off the line, because of a no-wheel spin launch with all-wheel-drive"". According to your precious magazines, it also out brakes the Porsche 911 GT2 from 80 mph and stops just 2 feet shorter than the 911 GT2 from 60 mph. That is real performance and if you try to argue that down, I believe I could safely say that it is a sign of a delusional mind.

Perhaps you should stop simply reading my posts, but should actually begin synthesising the data as well. I'm having a hard time responding to much of the outrageously false statements you've made thus far.

You did get one thing right though. Jaguar is getting diesel engines ready for the European market as they do make up for much of a manufacturer's sales there. That was a weak point for the X-TYPE: it had no diesels to compete against the 330d etc. with the high gasoline prices in Europe. Rest assured that when the engines are available, the X-TYPE will compete even better than it already does so well. And when I'm on the track, I'll remember to mention my car's boot to the Porsche that I out-brake and to the IS 300, A4, C320 that I out accelerate and the BMW driver that I'm dead-locked with. Even Road&Track took note of that."
"September 25, 2002 7:41PM",jagboyxtype,"Merc1-

Other marques are not claiming that they have more rigid structures than the X-TYPE has because they do not. You say that you'll go by what you feel feels more solid, however, I could just say that the X-TYPE feels more solid to me and say that the discussion is over. Either way, we cannot do that. AutoWeek had the measurements for structure rigidity in their article, and I even quoted them a little way back. They also noted that the X-TYPE's structure is 30% more rigid than the previous class leader's. That means that the previous class leader no longer has the class-leading structure in rigidity because the X-TYPE, now the class leader in structural rigidity, beats it by 30%. You are just choosing not to accept a fact.

As for the X v. C article, you say that they chose to test in areas where the X-TYPE would win, but then wouldn't other car media groups just be choosing areas in which the 330i wins? The same can be said about any comparison. Look at what is said in these articles, point-wise, the C-Class may win, however, in actual measurements, the X-TYPE beats it. Take for instance what Road&Track said about acceleration, which I quoted above in my message to riez.

Oh well, we don't agree on this one. At least you have an open mind enough to at least read the articles, etc. Whether you choose to believe what is said is you choice. Have a nice day."

I agree there, we've had this conversation before. Car and Driver is most guilty of this. Agreed. Their last comparo was seemingly decided on how the 330i handled mountain roads, something most people don't drive on. In my opinion Road and Track conducts about the fairest comparos.

It being more rigid than the X-TYPE has not been mentioned in any reviews that I have seen as of yet, so I cannot say that the car is more rigid than the X's structure. In many reviews, the editors have stated that the X-TYPE's structure is the class leader in measured rigidity, and as many reviews have concluded this, I accept the fact. If the measurements of the A4's rigidity came out and proved to be higher than the X-TYPE's, then I would accept that, however, at this moment, the X-TYPE is known as the most rigid car in its class.

This is not to say that the A4 has not surpassed the 3-Series in rigidity or possibly the X-TYPE, or to say that the car or any of the cars in this class are lacking in structural rigidity; it is simply to say that with the information available, all current measurements have proven the X-TYPE to be the most rigid to this day.

From these results

"September 27, 2002 11:14PM",jagboyxtype,"Actually, this isn't the X-TYPE we have here in the U.S.

This is the X-TYPE section of the car crash test above:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


Take note that this is the ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD"" marked under the ""Make, model and hand of drive"" portion of the chart at the bottom of the page. The X-TYPE 2.0 is the low-end Europe-only version of the car that lacks the extra driveshaft that the 2.5 and 3.0 litre models have that are sold globally (as well as the driveshaft that is found in the 3-Series and C-Class). Thus, its crash tests produce weaker results than the 2.5 and 3.0 versions, and 3-Series and C-Class, because 2.0 is a FWD car with no longitudal driveshaft that is found in AWD (X-TYPE) and RWD (C-Class, 3-Series) cars.


Check out this site:


http://www.hwysafety.org/vehicle_ratings/ce/html/0210.htm


It notes that the X-TYPE underwent structural changes after December 2001 but does not say if that was a version-specific change (which I discovered it was). A letter to Consumer Reports aided research, and their reply was as follows:


""We spoke with JNA (Jaguar North America) on this question and they explained that the Jaguar X-Type was originally introduced in Europe as a 2.0 litre FWD (Front Wheel Drive) model. The only models sold in the U.S. are 2.5 and 3.0 liter AWD versions.... that achieve better frontal crash test results than the FWD European model due to a prop shaft that runs the length of the car from front to rear. The prop to the rear supplies power to the rear wheels as well as the front, which accounts for the AWD traction... The modifications made and referred to in IIHS's report on X-Types (made) after December 2001 were actually modifications made to FWD European models and are not applicable to the U.S. AWD models.""

(Thanks ""JagDude"" and Consumer Reports for this information).


Also note that the reason why the C-Class recieved a 5-star rating in the European test over the 4-star rating that all of the others in this class recieved was because it was the only car that had a flashing light that lit-up a sign reading the equivalent of ""fasten your seatbelt"" on its dash, which is to become a standard feature in Europe in the future(?). It would have recieved that same 4-star rating had it not had the light. This is straight off the site:


""Extra points awarded for the way that the C-class reminds its passengers to buckle their seat belts have now made it the second car ever to gain a five-star crash protection rating. Results for the C-class were published last year and it achieved four stars. But Euro NCAP has since changed its scoring system to encourage car makers to fit seat-belt warnings.""


All in all, I'd feel very safe in any one of the cars in this class, and I do feel safe being in one of them. Stay safe everyone."
"September 29, 2002 10:58AM",linard,"I honestly cannot remember a car I've been in that HASN'T had a seatbelt warning light. Our 87 Mercedes 420 SEL had it and my 99 Honda Prelude has it. Maybe this is due to European influence as the Focus (originally introduced and designed in Europe) has an obnoxious system that beeps and chimes if the driver does not fasten within an allotted amount of time and other cars I've been in have ""sensed"" the weight of a passenger and have flashed the seatbelt light as well (I believe the LandCruiser does this). However, as the seatbelt usage stats are dropping in the US, maybe this is a good idea after all. I can personally attest my safety and my mother's life to seatbelts.

BTW JagBoy, the EuroNCAP X-Type was a 2002 and it stated that the FWD 2.0 was released March of that year which is supported by both CAR and Top Gear Magazines (British publications). In addition, I am relatively certain that the X-Type was introduced as an AWD model to differentiate it from the Mondeo and to keep it from alienating Jag owners who may have cringed at the thought of a FWD Jag (this is from a CAR article soon before the X-Type itself was introduced in May of 2001). However, as the base 2.5 is an already relatively expensive car and does not fare well against a C180 or 318i in terms of value, Jag decided to introduce the FWD 2.0 with a stick as standard.

From what I understand, the driveshaft does assist in distributing the crash impact rearward, however, the larger engine block of the 3.0 tends to push rearward earlier in an accident than the smaller block of the 2.0 with it's fewer driveline components (obviously as it is FWD) so the crumple zones of the 2.0 have more room to crumple. I believe this is the reason why Mercedes decided to replace the 3.2 inline 6 of the E class with the smaller block of the 3.2 V6 in 99 and the difference in crash test scores between a 97 and a 00 are pretty significant although I'm not sure if Mercedes conducted any significant changes to the structure since they lowered the hood by an inch."
"September 29, 2002 7:49PM",wishnhigh1,"""they DOUBLE their rigidity with EVERY platform update... since it's you telling me, i believe you, but that kinda boggles the mind... one would think there's a point where you can't go beyond?""

Well...yes theoretically speaking, there is a point where you cant go beyond...but nothin on the face of this earth that has a perfect structural rigidity.

We are talking about a large structure, on the scale of 100s of centimeters, which carries payloads of about 1000 pounds, and is subject to stresses incurred by hard braking and acceleration and cornering. Not to mention the constraints that mass production places on structural rigidity.

There is still a lot of flex in even the most rigid of automobiles. Even full out race cars have problems from structural rigidity...I believe the initial Audi R8 had multiple problems with body flex...parts of the body would pinch and snap hoses and electrical lines.

So, yes, there is tons of room for improvement in all cars in the area of rigidity."
"September 30, 2002 9:28PM",jagboyxtype,"Yes, my X-TYPE also has a seatbelt warning light in the dash. Most all cars do. In addition, it chimes at you when you do not have your seatbelt on, and it has sensors in the seats that measure how much the occupant of the seat weighs and more sensors determine how far the occupants are from the dash and steering wheel so that it can calculate how much force to use when firing airbags in the event of a collision. A small amber light in the corner of the wood veneer on the passenger's side lights up and displays whether the occupant there weighs enough for the airbag to be automatically turned on or off, and the seats automatically also turn off the airbags if a baby or childseat is detected.

The warning system in the Mercedes C-Class in that test was a different light from the ones we have in our cars here. Notice that the C-Class had scored a 4-star rating in the test just as all of the other cars in that class did, but because of the addition of another light that said ""put on your seatbelt"", the car's score was later changed to a 5 to promote more lights that say ""put on your seatbelt"" to be used in other cars. I'm not saying that the C does not deserve a high rating in crash tests, but its additional star over the other cars in its class is simply because it has an additional light that tells passengers to wear their seatbelts on top of the light on the dash that says to wear your seatbelt. It is not necessarily safer than the other cars because of that light, and so I do not believe that it should have gotten an entire extra star for a light.


You are also wrong about the 3.0 Jaguar engine ""pushing"" into the cabin in a crash before the 2.5 and 2.0 because they are the same engine blocks but the 3.0 has been drilled-out more to be larger. Also, the engines do not enter the cabins at any time in a crash because the X-TYPE is designed to ""drop"" its engine when it is in a severe frontal crash. Most modern cars do this. X-TYPE's engines are also mounted horizonatally, so they are not taking up a terrible amount of longitudal space in the engine bay, thus the chances of them penetrating the passenger cabin is slim in comparison to longitudally oriented engines. Again, however, the X-TYPE drops its engine when it has a severe frontal crash, so it never enters the passenger compartment no matter what engine size is used. The argument that a 2.0 FWD X-TYPE would be safer than an AWD larger displacement version is null and void, because the engine does not enter the cabin at any time during any impact.


You really should read the bottom chart of the EuroNCAP page for the X-TYPE:


http://euroncap.com/details.php3?id=car_117_2002


It specifically states that the car is: ""Jaguar X-Type 2.0 LHD. Only the FWD X-TYPE is built with the 2.0-litre engine, which again is the same engine block as the 2.5 and 3.0, but not drilled-out as much. All other X-TYPEs are built in AWD configuration. The AWD driveshaft of the AWD X-TYPEs aid in collisions v. the FWD version that is sold alongside them in Europe against 318 and C180.


Mercedes-Benz decided to changed to a V6 from an I6 because they lowered the bonnet of the E-Class between those configurations and could not fit the I-6 under the lowered bonnet, as well as because it may have cost less to produce and it could be used in more vahicles as it had better packaging. That is also the reason for the discontinuation of the E300 diesel, as the diesel engine could not fit under the lowered bonnet that was used when the V6 was introduced (that and because the E300 did not sell well here). The E-Class should have been designed to drop its engine in a crash as well. I've not heard of a modern car being designed so that its engine penetrates the passenger compartment in a collision."
"October 1, 2002 4:37PM",linard,"While the C-Class did gain an extra star because NCAP changed it's guidelines earlier this year on performance in crashes and safety features provided, the C class did earn it's full 5 stars as it's a very well designed car collision-wise, when I can find the article in which NCAP justified giving the C class an extra star b/c of it's overall performance, I'll paste the link. As the pre 2003 E Class also includes this seatbelt light, your logic would conclude that it too, should receive 5 stars from it's previous 4 when it doesn't.

The fact that car engines are not designed to go into the passenger compartment is obvious, what isn't as obvious is while the X-Type is designed to, as you describe, drop it's engine and driveline components, they will always ""push"" into the compartment as evidenced by the Insurance Institute's listing of the crash details in which the X-Type exhibited moderate footwell intrusion, between 8 to 12 cm. The best rated C Class, on the other hand, had intrusion measures of 2 to 3 cm. Engineers are constantly trying to limit this phenomenon. While I don't doubt the driveshaft aids in crash test scores, I wasn't trying to prove one way or another, I was speculating on a possible alternative.

And while I may be wrong on the engine block of the 2.0 being different from the 2.5 and the 3.0, I am certain that the E class' hood and front fender structures were lowered as a result of the new engine's newfound underhood space, and not due to the new engines being introduced b/c of the lowered hoodline. This is evidenced by the 99 E320 having the V6 with the prefacelifted hoodline. The discontinuation of the E300 in the U.Ss WAS caused by the low demand for that particular car AND b/c of the structural change. However, that never meant that Mercedes dropped diesels from it's complete linup, in fact, Europe still has the option of a few remarkable diesel E class engines which Mercedes could have introduced here along with the redesigned 2000 E Class."

"October 2, 2002 12:33AM",wishnhigh1,"I have seen 3 Mercedes cars in accidents where the cars were totalled, two of which were rollover accidents.

One of the rollover accidents was an S430, and it had a mild cabin protrusion, but nothing serious. The cabin was in perfect shape basically. The other was I believe a 600SEL. This one was extremely important because even though this car had pillarless windows, the roof of the car did not cave in at all, even though the car came to a rest upside down. The guy was still in the car at the time, and he was hanging upside down, with no visual bruises, and a few minor cuts from broken glass.

The third accident was an E320 which was involved in a head on collision with a Camaro, who was racing another Camaro on a 2 lane road. I didnt see the drivers, but I saw the car as it was being towed away, and again, no cabin protrusion at all. The car was completely destroyed up to the point where the footwell started.

Im generally dont praise late model Mercedes', but I will always say glamorous things about them when it comes to safety. In my opinion, they are a few steps above volvo. They also have some of the strongest roof structures short of a 3"" thick roll bar."
"October 2, 2002 3:38AM",sphinx99,"I'll say it up front, I don't think Edmunds does a consistent job on sedan reviews. I understand the whole ""they're in BMW's payroll"" thing as well as the ""but we're not"" thing. This month's letters to the editors & Edmunds' responses make good points on both sides.

Unfortunately, Edmunds does a fabulous job of putting numbers to their words that later can be dug up and compared. I'm specifically looking at the entry level luxury sedan comparos - 2001 where a TL-S edged out a 330i, then 2002 where a 330i wiped the floor with the competition. The idea (and some will agree while others disagree) is that the scores tended to deliberately put BMW above the Acura.

Is this happening? Well, I decided to look at the numbers behind the comparisons to find out. Given identical cars, whereas the two were eventually matched on performance in 2001, now there is a 20 point spread between them in 2002. What, Acura got slower or BMW got faster? Given identical front seat comfort in 2001, now for 2002 BMW front seat comfort is tops while Acura's is bottom. Did the seats actually change, or did the editors of the 2002 review have smaller rumps?

Not that only Acura gets the shaft either. In 2001 BMW got a higher ""feature content"" rating than the TL-S. In 2002, a 330i with MORE features than the 2001 model only tied the feature content rating than a TL-S with the same features. This in spite of the fact that features the 330i lacked in 2001 (dual zone climate control, indash CD changer) were simply left off the Top 10 features list in 2002, leaving BMW as a vehicle that offers every Top 10 feature as either standard or optional.

Basically, I like the prose of the articles and take away many good things from reading them. When I look at the rankings, though, they seem to be statistically invalid; if, twelve months later, your opinions on identical seats can change that much, then how can you rank these cars based on 1% differences in the final rankings?

In one of the comparos, it was stated that the margin for error was about 0.5%, and any two cars tallying numbers within .5% of each other would be considered tied. I suggest increasing that buffer to 10% in order to account for the startling differences you find between two cars after just one year.

Until then, I'm going to stop reading into the numbers and ranking, and concentrate on the prose and photographs. We spend a great deal of effort arguing here about which sedan came in #1 and which one came in #2. If you look at the numbers used to actually rank these vehicles against each other, they fluctuate so wildly from one set of editors to another (you'd think that using a set of editors would even out the fluctuation) so as to make the ranking of these vehicles practically worthless.

Front seat comfort
2001: Acura 83, BMW 83
2002: BMW 9.2, Acura 7.6

Rear seat comfort
2001: BMW 74 Acura 70
2002: Acura 9.2 BMW 5.8

Conclusion: either BMW and Acura received total redesigns in 2002 unbeknownst to all of us, or the editor butt-o-meter does not produce repeatable results."
"October 2, 2002 7:46AM",sweetjeldorado,"I was noticing how the hood ornament was still standing. :-) Anyhow, all I can say is that Mercedes still rule in crashes.

About seat comfort, my theory is seats are mass produce by suppliers and sometimes maybe precision of making the seats can run off track. Who knows. Probably the reason they were not as comfortable in Acura in 2002 as was in 2001. Don't know how to go about that one.

"October 2, 2002 1:25PM",linard,"I can personally vouch for the excellent performance of Benzes in collisions, my mom had a gray market 1981 500 SL that was broadsided at a perfectly 90 degree angle to her car at 40 - 50 miles an hour. She walked away with no serious injuries, just some muscle tension and whiplash. The other car was totalled and although the side of the car was basically crushed in, the passenger compartment's space was maintained. In addition, the door would still open and close normally and she was able to, amazingly, drive it home. I remember how thick the doors on the ""Dallas"" era SL's were, amazing... Took 30,000 to fix it and even then, it was never the same. We also had a 1987 420 SEL that was rear ended by a Pontiac Bonneville at approx 25 mph and the Pontiac's front was pretty damaged to about the front wheels. Our Benz, on the other hand, suffered little more than scrapes along the length of the bumper, but no structural damage, the bumper wasn't even displaced at all.

"October 2, 2002 1:47PM",blueguydotcom,Typical german engineering. I was in an 01 golf that a yahoo in a huge pickup broadsided at 40. No intrusion into the passenger compartment at all.
"October 2, 2002 4:41PM",sphinx99,"""Just wanted to share with everyone that, after those things happen to you, brand loyalty takes on a whole new meaning...""

Of course, it goes both ways. Many years ago in my first ever car, a 1988 Ford Taurus that I loved to death, I was rear-ended while sitting at a red light by an almost brand new Mercedes E-class. He had some bumper damage and the front hood was a bit bent. In contrast, my Taurus was destroyed--I was slammed into a Buick in front of me, and half the engine bay and almost all of the trunk were completely collapsed. To the dearly departed Taurus's credit, there wasn't any cabin intrusion, and I only bruised my shins, but the car was totaled while the Benz probably picked up a thousand dollars worth of body work. I'll never forget the Mercedes dude getting out of his car and bending over to keenly examine his slightly crunched bumper while I stared at my utterly destroyed car.

On a more positive note, that was the last Ford I ever owned. Whew!

In conclusion: Mercedes sedans are notable not only for their defense, but for their offense as well. If I were looking to take out Dodge Neon drivers, literally, I'd pick a S500 as my instrument of mayhem. If you're looking to drive while combing your hair, talking on the cell phone and changing radio stations at the same time, but do not want to sit in a Ford Expedition, then an E-class may be for you!"

TSX auto (uses small 2.4L I4 that needs high RPMs for power)
A4 1.8t auto (esp. heavier AWD version)
X-type 2.5 auto (made heavier by standard AWD)
MB C230 (esp. heavier AWD version)

Noticed you left one car off your comments: Lexus IS300. You should take one for a spin. My wife loves her IS300 automatic.

If you are considering the Cadillac CTS, you should also look at the Lincoln LS6. Lincoln dealers are really discounting these fine cars. Most CTS' I've seen at two local Cadillac dealers tend to be loaded up with $5-7K worth of options. Hard to find one near $30K.

If you want powerful car and don't mind FWD, you might consider Acura 3.2TL, Infiniti I35, Nissan Maxima SE, or Nissan Altima 3.5SE.

Jag S-type is not normally considered ""near luxury"". Thinking its base price starts in the low $40,000s and quickly moves up with options. If you can afford this, you might consider BMW 5 Series (525i or 530i) or Lexus GS300."

I don't know... but those stories just turned me off to that car. as for a 5 series bmw... well I love that car... esspecally the new desighn... yet I don't think I can lease one... or well I don't know if I could or couldn't ... I have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is 300 and then thers another 250 from parents on top of that but I'd rather not have a 450 - 500 $ lease payment but I don't know... any suggestions... ?any one know what a 5 series or even a base MB E class leases for? just wondering thank you all very much"
"September 28, 2003 12:12PM",riez,"cjs2002... You have me thoroughly confused. Are you in the under $40,000 range or not?

At post #198 you wrote, ""tryin to see if I can get a deal on a base [Jaguar] 3.0 S type and go from there."" The Jaguar S-type competes with Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, and MB E-class.

Then at post #205 you write, ""now as to the [Lexus] ES300 and [BMW] 330[i] I like but they are out of my price range."" How can these two cars, that are less expensive than a Jaguar S-type, be out of your price range?

If you can buy or lease a Jaguar S-type, you could certainly buy or lease an ES300 or 330i.

Then you also write, ""I have no idea as to how well they lease... my max payment is [$]300 and then there is another [$]250 from parents on top of that but I'd rather not have a [$]450 - 500$ lease payment but I don't know.""

What you can afford to lease is way different than what you can buy. You should check out the various lease deals. Jaguar X-type leases heavily subsidized. Seen some inexpensive rates with 3 Series."
"September 28, 2003 12:48PM",ruski,"I had a 300M for 3 years and - no problems. I'd say that most 300M drivers that I know of have not had any problems, especially with the drivetrain.

I leased a 2002 Acura TL-S and the tranny failed after 6,100 miles. Go figure."
"September 28, 2003 12:53PM",cjs2002,"lol sorry for the confusion... everything I'm looking at is based on how it will lease... and yeah I'm leasing what ever car I may get then... so I know my max payment is about 500 for a lease mind you... not a buy. I just wanted to know if,... at least I'm pretty shir that the X, the G35 and the C230 all lease for under 500 but i don't know about say a E class... I hope I don't confuse you... what I'm trying to get at is that if stepping into say a E class isn't much more expensive than getting a C in terms of lease payments then would it be better to lease an E over the C... I don't know... I'm not the one who handles the money factor and negotiations... my father negotiates it to with in my budgette and then I just pay it no questions asked...lol... sounds dumb but oh well.. yeah my main cars that I'm looking at I'd half to say is below the 35K range... actually below the 33K sticker range cause then my father can negotiate the final prices... once again sorry for anyconfussion I'm just rateling off possibilities befor I make the final plunge into buying ... wait let me correct that ... leasing my own car... thank you all"
"September 28, 2003 6:56PM",riez,"cjs2002... Not sure what to make. Pulled up your profile: ""The car I am shopping for is a 2003 Nissan Altima. And the car I own now is a 1992 Buick LeSabre.""

Huge difference between an Altima and an E-class. Even bigger difference between nearly every car we've talked about an a LeSabre.

Let me know what you end up buying. Best thing for you to do is serious test driving. And crunch your lease deal numbers."
"September 29, 2003 5:15AM",cyberpmg,"I've been really pleased with the A4 with Quattro (AWD). I have the 3.0 with the Tiptronic (automatic) transmission and live and work in the Cleveland area. The 1.8T is a nice car, but the weight tends to make it sluggish. It can be improved with aftermarket performance products (chip, exhaust, etc.), but would bring you up in price to the 3.0.

The A4 3.0 has one of the nicest interiors around. I also do mostly highway driving, and the interior combined with the performance handling makes this a pleasureable ride. In winter, the Quattro system really shines. I've been able to drive through some nasty snowstorms over the past 2 years, and I've always felt under control wherever I was going.

Audi also has a 4 year / 50,000 mile service program that covers all service at no cost to you. With that along with the 4 year / 50,000 mile warranty, all you'll spend is for gas and tires (if needed). With the 2004 models now appearing on the lots, you can make a good deal on any remaining 2003s.

Just some insight from a fellow Cleveland driver! =) Good luck in your decision."
"September 29, 2003 2:44PM",vipbarr,"I had many problems with my G35 sedan, but the brake pads/rotor problem tops them all. I was due for front brakes. Quite early IMO but that is another story. The service representative told me, that my rotors are warped and I need to pay to replace the rotors. According to many sources (dealers and Infiniti customer service), most of the G35 require rotor replacement in addition to costly brake job. Infiniti knows about the problem and IS NOT paying for the rotors. Be prepared to buy yourself a new set of rotors for every brake job. And you will need this quite often, to the delight of your local dealer. Unfortunately, I was one of the early victims and did not expect that the car will be so bug ridden as it is. I would never buy this POS knowing what I know not, but is too late. It is by far the worst car I ever had. For 16 months I have been to a dealer 12 times. Let prospective buyers be aware."
