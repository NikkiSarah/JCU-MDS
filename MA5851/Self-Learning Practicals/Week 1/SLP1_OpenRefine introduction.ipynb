    "# Cleaning & Exploring your Data with Open Refine\n",
    "\n",
    "## Open Refine\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Open Refine\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Elegant Interface:** OpenRefine has elegant and easy to use spread sheet like interface that allows user to have direct interaction with data. Users can manipulate data and see the changes immediately. Furthermore, all controls are visible, position and arranged in accordance to their likelihood for usage. For instances, controls for the operations related to columns are grouped together and placed above each column of the dataset in a drop down list. This naturally establishes the relationship between these controls and data in column for users.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient Memory Usage:** OpenRefne does not load all the data from the disk in to the memory of system at once. Because dataset can be huge and usually a system has limited memory as compare to dataset. Therefore, Open Refine only loads number of rows that are visible to user from the disk. Users are able to manipulate with rows visible to them and thus system is able to efciently utilize its resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Search, Filter and Cluster:** OpenRefine supports columns based search and filter operation that allows user to quickly and efciently view the portion of dataset of their interest. Search operation includes keywords text search where as filter includes text facets, numeric facet, time line facets and custom facets. These facets allows user to extract a portion of data from whole dataset based on its feature. For example user can extract all rows for a column that contains numeric values only; using numeric facet. OpenRefine also allows its users to apply multiple filter at the same time. Furthermore based on applied fillters it automatically presents cluster of data with in the dataset to the user. These clusters are formed based on textual similarity of in the dataset. Search, filter and cluster operations become very crucial for user to view data from different aspects and re-view the effect of cleaning operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **History Management :** History management is feature of Open Refine that keeps the track of all changes applied on dataset. User can revert or re-do those changes as per their requirements. This gives user a safe way to manipulate and clean data without having the fear for important or required data being lost while performing any clean operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Project Management :** OpenRefine treats every individual data set as a project. These projects are portable and the state of these projects are maintained through out the cleaning phase of dataset. As a result user can backup, import and export these project to other machines and perform the cleaning activity in multiple sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Refine is also a powerful free big data tool for exploring, normalising and cleaning-up semi-structured or poorly structured data and is excellent for RDF cleaning and preparation.  It is also good for geocoding, handling missing vlaues and can use many open APIs to supplementing or source datasets from the open web.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is most useful where you have data in a simple tabular format, but with internal inconsistencies either in data formats, or where data appears, or in terminology used. It can help you with:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "● Messy data from multiple inconsistent sources\n",
    "● Improve the quality of your data by refining it and using the power of the internet<br>\n",
    "● Missing Values\n",
    "● Get an overview of a data set<br>\n",
    "● Resolve inconsistencies in a data set<br>\n",
    "● Help you split data up into more granular parts<br>\n",
    "● Match local data up to other data sets<br> \n",
    "● Building Tand cleaning Triples / RDF's for linked open data<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "RDF quality extension has a client-server architecture because it is based on the architecture5 of OpenRefine. However, since OpenRefine is intended to be used locally on user's machine therefore both client and server side are installed\n",
    "on the same system. The client side of the extension is integrated with graphical user interface of OpenRefine. Therefore it functions and deals in the same manner as defined by Open Refine. The only difference comes when user selects any RDF cleaning operation and as a consequence an Ajax post call with respect selected command is send to the server which is handled by\n",
    "server side implementation of the extension. This Ajax post call consist of all necessary information required by server-side of the extension to execute the requested command. It includes project id, command id, column id, etc. The entire client side is implemented in java script.\n",
    "https://github.com/OpenRefine/OpenRefine/wiki/Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The server side of the extension is responsible for retrieving, maintaining, updating versions of dataset with respect to operations applied on them. Each command is identified based on its 'command id' a received through Ajax post call from the client. The particular portion of dataset is identi\f",
    "ed using 'project id' from Ajax post call and project's state. This portion of data is retrieved and processed with accordance to command executed over it. Each command consists of one or more than one operations. An operation is a unit task executed over the dataset. The sequence of the execution of operation as defined in the command is important because the changes made by one operation over the dataset is required by the other. Once the command is executed successfully, an Ajax notification is sent to the client side to notify the user. Furthermore, state of the project is updated and a record about changes in the dataset is stored as history.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Install Open Refine\n",
    "In this lecture and tutorial set we will learn how to encode information with spatial position, how to facet data between multiple views, how to reduce the amount of data shown by filtering and aggregation using open refine and how to connect to open API data for reconcillation, geocoding and named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Open Refine uses GREL (Google Refine Expression Language). More info on GREL syntax can be found here http://code.google.com/p/google-refine/wiki/UnderstandingExpressions.\n",
    "  \n",
    "But First lets :  \n",
    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "To install Open Refine:\n",
    "1. Go to the main Open Refine website: http://openrefine.org/\n",
    "2. Browse to the Download OpenRefine section.\n",
    "3. Choose the appropriate download for your operating system. Windows, Mac and Linux are all supported.\n",
    "4. Follow the installation procedures for your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Topic 1\n",
    "### Typical workflow:\n",
    "1. Import dataset – CSV, tab – file, URL\n",
    "2. Rearrange, split, sort\n",
    "3. Explore data using facets\n",
    "4. Use cluster analysis to make consistent\n",
    "5. Supplement with an API call\n",
    "6. Repeat 2-5\n",
    "7. Export dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "### Faceting:\n",
    "- Grouping the dataset based on one or more parameters, properties, fields, columns\n",
    "- Like tagging\n",
    "- You can then explore just those records at the intersection of the facets\n",
    "- A “suburb” facet, for instance, would group all records that have the same suburb\n",
    "- A “gene symbol” facet, for instance, would group all records that have the same gene symbol \n",
    "- Possible to facet on text, number ranges, pairs of numbers, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Clustering\n",
    "- Often faceting will reveal inconsistencies in the data\n",
    "- Cluster analysis attempts to form clusters of data based on certain algorithms\n",
    "- Open Refine allows you try a variety of clustering methods\n",
    "- These are quite good at revealing inconsistencies : \n",
    "  - 10-12 Church St. vs 10,12 Church Street\n",
    "  - Kriesler vs Chrysler\n",
    " \n",
    "### APIs\n",
    "- Increasingly, APIs are being used to expose services – databases, registries, mapping services, etc.\n",
    "- Open Refine makes it relatively straightforward to call into an API, receive a response, and supplement your dataset with a portion of it.\n",
