When there is a slowdown in vaccination programmes people who are not immunised will need to minimise their exposure to the virus and so will stay in their homes for longer periods of time which will affect patterns of demand, Prof Selva Demiralp told BBC World News.
If people get Covid-19 they will not be able to work and these two factors combined could increase the risk of a slower economic recovery, she added.
Even when countries which are able to eliminate the pandemic domestically, they will still also face economic costs if their trade partners have not been able to do the same, Prof Demiralp explained.

Doctors believed she was experiencing a mental health breakdown, but she later learned she had encephalitis – a rare but serious condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain in a situation called “friendly fire”.
While in hospital, an accident on the psychiatric ward led Lucy to become permanently disabled.
""At one point I really thought my life was over, I was so depressed,"" she says. ""But somehow I managed to turn it around - I was so unlucky, but at the same time I'm so lucky to have persevered.""
Now a successful model and disability advocate, Lucy talks about her time in hospital, why she likes to make sure her mobility aids are pictured on lingerie shoots, and how she deals with online trolls.

Initially he responded well to treatment, but in June 2020 a scan showed that he’d had a relapse.
“We were considering surgery at one point, because I was doing so well,"" he says.
“One of the reasons that they were hesitant on doing that was because of the pandemic.”
The group One Cancer Voice, made up of over 40 cancer charities, estimates that millions of people like George have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. 
It also wants to see the government focus on diagnosing cancer in people who have not sought medical advice for symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic.
The government says cancer treatment remains a top priority and urges people to see their GP if they have symptoms.

""If you don't like what you're doing, then you've got to change,"" he said.
""As long as you work hard at what you do and you enjoy it, I guess that's all that counts.""

New additions to the team's fleet include ultra-lightweight deployable drones and a new flagship heavyweight drone with thermal imaging.
The heavyweight Matrice 300 drone, which is named Delta November 1, can be deployed in low-visibility operations and during adverse weather conditions.
The drone is named in honour of the co-founder of the Foyle Search and Rescue drone team, Danny Nelis, who passed away in 2019.

When Tunisians overthrew the autocratic President Ben Ali in 2011, their core demands seemed to be simple - jobs, freedom and dignity. But over the years, the 'simple' got complicated.
Ten years on, Tunisia's democratic change has fallen short of mending economic and social inequalities. Almost every year, thousands take to the streets demanding change.
In this short film, the BBC's North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad, examines the underlying struggles beyond the people's core demands, as young Tunisians strive to shape the post-revolution dream.
