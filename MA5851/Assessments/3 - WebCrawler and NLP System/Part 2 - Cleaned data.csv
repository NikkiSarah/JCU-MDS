Dr Ayoade Alakija told BBC World News that the vaccine is being rolled out to over two billion people and is often the only option available.
But countries with large populations of under 30s will question why they are being asked to take it when other countries like the UK are offering alternatives for that age group, Dr Alakija said.
The European Union’s medicines regulator has said unusual blood clots should be listed as a possible very rare side effect of the AstraZeneca’s coronavirus vaccine, but that the benefits outweighed the risks.
AstraZeneca has said that both the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) reviews reaffirmed that the benefits of the vaccine ""continue to far outweigh the risks"".",,,2021-04-08 23:55:37+10:00,Coronavirus,,,BBC News,World,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-56678379
6895,Golfers tee off at midnight as Covid rules relaxed,,Covid-19: Derbyshire golfers tee off at midnight as restrictions eased,"Golfers teed off at midnight as England's coronavirus lockdown restrictions were eased and courses reopened.
Using glow-in-the-dark balls and floodlit greens, Morley Hayes Golf Club, in Derbyshire, believes it was the first to reopen in England.
Andrew Allsop, managing director of the club, said the idea to hold a midnight charity event was made ""on a whim"".
""It filled instantly. There was so much interest because I don't think there are any places in England that do night golf and we obviously want to try and get in the records that we're the first ones to reopen on 29 March,"" he said.
The event raised more than £2,000 for the Nottingham Breast Cancer Research Centre.
Golf is among the outdoor activities that can now take place in England, with courses allowed to reopen along with football and cricket pitches, tennis and basketball courts, and outdoor swimming pools.

6896,‘Delayed vaccine rollouts have economic costs’,"The longer the pandemic lasts the longer people will remain unemployed, says Prof Selva Demiralp.",‘Delayed Covid-19 vaccine rollouts have economic costs’,"Several European countries have paused the use of a coronavirus vaccine over the safety concerns, but delays to the rollout of coronavirus vaccine programmes will have an economic fallout, a professor of economics at Koç University, has said.
When there is a slowdown in vaccination programmes people who are not immunised will need to minimise their exposure to the virus and so will stay in their homes for longer periods of time which will affect patterns of demand, Prof Selva Demiralp told BBC World News.
If people get Covid-19 they will not be able to work and these two factors combined could increase the risk of a slower economic recovery, she added.
Even when countries which are able to eliminate the pandemic domestically, they will still also face economic costs if their trade partners have not been able to do the same, Prof Demiralp explained.

Foyle Search and Rescue overhauled its drone programme this year, with the addition of six new drones.
The charity, which is based in Londonderry, was formed in 1993 by local people in response to an alarmingly high number of lives being lost in the area that year.
The suicide prevention charity works with a number of local agencies to help preserve life in the north west.
New additions to the team's fleet include ultra-lightweight deployable drones and a new flagship heavyweight drone with thermal imaging.
The heavyweight Matrice 300 drone, which is named Delta November 1, can be deployed in low-visibility operations and during adverse weather conditions.
The drone is named in honour of the co-founder of the Foyle Search and Rescue drone team, Danny Nelis, who passed away in 2019.

6899,Is Earth's love affair with plastic over?,The Earth's relationship with plastic started over 100 years ago. But is it time we broke up?,Planet and plastic: End of the love story?,"On top of everything else, the coronavirus pandemic has led to an increase in plastic waste across the world.
Experts estimate that in the past year, around 100 billion single-use face masks have been binned every month - and we don't have the means to safely dispose of this huge amount.
On top of that, with industry across the globe grinding to a halt - including oil, which plastic is made from - it's now cheaper to make brand new plastic than it is to recycle old items into new.
But this wasn't always the case. There was once a time when we celebrated plastic as a technical marvel, one which was making our lives simpler and easier.
So is our relationship with plastic at an end? Should we call this a break up? An 'it's not me, it's definitely you' moment?

6900,'It felt like the universe was out to get me',George missed out on cancer surgery and is now relying on experimental treatment.,Covid and cancer: 'It felt like the universe was out to get me',"When 20-year-old George Hatfield was diagnosed in 2019 he was told by doctors that he was one of the youngest people to have oesophageal cancer in the UK.
Initially he responded well to treatment, but in June 2020 a scan showed that he’d had a relapse.
“We were considering surgery at one point, because I was doing so well,"" he says.
“One of the reasons that they were hesitant on doing that was because of the pandemic.”
The group One Cancer Voice, made up of over 40 cancer charities, estimates that millions of people like George have had their cancer care affected in some way by the pandemic. 
It also wants to see the government focus on diagnosing cancer in people who have not sought medical advice for symptoms during the coronavirus pandemic.
The government says cancer treatment remains a top priority and urges people to see their GP if they have symptoms.

Doctors believed she was experiencing a mental health breakdown, but she later learned she had encephalitis – a rare but serious condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain in a situation called “friendly fire”.
While in hospital, an accident on the psychiatric ward led Lucy to become permanently disabled.
""At one point I really thought my life was over, I was so depressed,"" she says. ""But somehow I managed to turn it around - I was so unlucky, but at the same time I'm so lucky to have persevered.""
Now a successful model and disability advocate, Lucy talks about her time in hospital, why she likes to make sure her mobility aids are pictured on lingerie shoots, and how she deals with online trolls.

There was no data yet in the public domain breaking down the age or gender of people who had been affected by blood clots ""but we are certainly hearing that it's generally occurring in younger adults rather than in older adults so it may well be the case that we decide to start limiting the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine for younger people"", Prof Hunter said, but we would need to see the data first.
The UK’s regulator the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is expected to announce an update in the next few days. It has said that the benefits of the jab continue to outweigh any risk.

6906,Farmers hope new law will save native breeds,,Farmers hope Agriculture Act will save native East Midlands breeds,"Farmers are hoping the government puts words into action to protect native breeds of livestock in the East Midlands.
The Agriculture Act, passed in November, has promised ""measures"" and ""financial incentives"" to protect Britain's declining native breeds - traditional livestock that have adapted to Britain's climate and topography over centuries.
However, farmers still have questions about what these measures will be and how their animals will be affected.
Jon Thornes, director of South Ormsby Estate in Lincolnshire, said: ""Now it's about putting their words into action.""
Adam Henson, farmer and Countryfile presenter, added he thought there was a ""huge place"" for native breeds.
Half of Britain's native livestock is on a Rare Breeds Survival Trust watchlist, meaning they could be at risk of extinction.
According to the trust, all the major native breeds associated with the East Midlands, such as Border Leicester sheep and Lincoln Red cattle, are under threat.
In a statement, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said: ""We are working closely with stakeholder groups to develop these measures.""

One of the most common misconceptions about PTSD is that it mainly affects military personnel, but this isn't the case. Olivia, who endured a traumatic childbirth, and former Facebook moderator Chris were diagnosed with PTSD before the pandemic and have since sought treatment.
